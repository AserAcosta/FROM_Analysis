Previously on From...

2
00:00:10,505 --> 00:00:11,742
I hear their voices.

3
00:00:11,747 --> 00:00:14,053
They said it was the
only way to go home.

4
00:00:14,058 --> 00:00:16,367
Sara, just tell me what you did.

5
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:17,867
I left the door open.

6
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,046
Are you living in town or Colony House?

7
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:22,671
- Town.
- Julie.

8
00:00:23,105 --> 00:00:24,226
Colony House.

9
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:25,783
Why are you doing this?

10
00:00:25,788 --> 00:00:26,876
What's wrong?

11
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:29,671
I think maybe I-I made a mistake.

12
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:33,462
Julie, there are no mistakes,
just choices,

13
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:36,069
and you chose what was right
for you, and that matters.

14
00:00:36,074 --> 00:00:37,093
Come on, try it out!

15
00:00:37,098 --> 00:00:38,461
Every single one of these pins

16
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:40,656
is a different resident who drove in

17
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:42,097
from a different location.

18
00:00:42,102 --> 00:00:44,882
That is fucking impossible.

19
00:00:44,887 --> 00:00:49,093
I don't just sit around,
accepting the world as it is!

20
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:51,100
Someone is doing this,

21
00:00:51,105 --> 00:00:53,117
and I'm not gonna rest
until I figure out how!

22
00:00:53,122 --> 00:00:55,258
I wish you had the luxury of grief,

23
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,786
but you don't, Boyd.

24
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,289
These people need you.

25
00:00:58,294 --> 00:01:01,351
You need to be the one
to lead these people home.

26
00:01:01,356 --> 00:01:03,929
'Cause if you don't?
She died for nothing.

27
00:01:03,934 --> 00:01:06,390
What are you doing here?
You promised you'd stay home.

28
00:01:06,395 --> 00:01:08,089
If I didn't show up, they
would have wondered why.

29
00:01:08,093 --> 00:01:10,101
- It'll be okay.
- Sara...

30
00:01:10,106 --> 00:01:11,281
I promise.

31
00:01:11,286 --> 00:01:13,585
Do you wanna help me bring
over the rest of the food?

32
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,983
Yeah!

33
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:19,726
I just feel so... broken.

34
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:21,617
We're gonna figure it out together.

35
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,258
Don't worry.

36
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:26,734
- Whatcha got there?
- Sweet potatoes.

37
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:29,335
Nice family.

38
00:01:34,435 --> 00:01:36,515
_

39
00:01:43,307 --> 00:01:44,613
Sara!

40
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:46,318
Hey. Oh! Oh, no, no, no.

41
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:48,109
Okay, grab her,
grab her arm, grab her arm!

42
00:01:48,114 --> 00:01:49,367
Hold on, hold on!

Hey, Alma. Come on.

45
00:02:02,265 --> 00:02:05,734
There you go, Alma,
a fresh batch just for you.

46
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:08,804
Hey! Make sure you share this time.

47
00:02:09,468 --> 00:02:12,125
Nathan! Nathan!

48
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,003
It's your sister! Something
happened at the diner.

49
00:02:15,137 --> 00:02:17,109
They're taking her to the clinic.

50
00:02:24,342 --> 00:02:26,398
I really am feeling much better.

51
00:02:26,403 --> 00:02:29,593
I still think you should spend
the night for observation, okay?

52
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:30,971
Do I have to?

53
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:32,361
It's just, with things like this,

54
00:02:32,365 --> 00:02:34,476
it's best not to take
any chances, you know?

55
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:37,315
I can have someone go get Nathan.

56
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,367
He can stay with you.

57
00:02:38,372 --> 00:02:42,420
No. He worries. If he comes by,

58
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:46,570
could you... just tell him I'm sleeping.

59
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:48,193
Yeah, no problem.

60
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:56,320
I'll, uh... I'll be right back, okay?

61
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:07,835
Hey. How's she doing?

62
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,437
I mean, fine, given the circumstances.

63
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,299
Has this happened before?

64
00:03:13,304 --> 00:03:14,898
Well, I mean, not according to Sara.

65
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,820
And unless there's an MRI
machine tucked around somewhere,

66
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:19,625
there's no way to really
know what's going on.

67
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,671
- Yeah.
- I'm, uh...

68
00:03:20,676 --> 00:03:23,164
I'm gonna keep her overnight
and see if anything changes.

69
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:25,570
Okay. You sure you're ready for that?

70
00:03:25,575 --> 00:03:28,203
Look, I don't know
how that door got open,

71
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,242
but I'm not gonna let those things

72
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:31,906
take this place away from me.

73
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,991
They've already taken too much already.

74
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:36,921
Yeah. They sure have.

75
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,273
Hey, can I ask you a question?

76
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:43,788
These seizures first,
the Matthews kid, now Sara.

77
00:03:44,447 --> 00:03:45,658
You think it's possible

78
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:47,868
to have a physical
reaction to this place?

79
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:50,202
Maybe something you
might normally diagnose

80
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:52,045
as one thing on the
outside, but here it's...

81
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,922
Look, Boyd, if you asked
me this six months ago,

82
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:57,358
I would have said anything that
we've seen here was impossible.

83
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,241
But the truth is, I...

84
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:04,022
Okay, how long has
this been going on for?

85
00:04:05,974 --> 00:04:07,867
Long enough that it's got
me asking stupid questions.

86
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:09,699
- Boyd...
- I'm fine.

87
00:04:09,845 --> 00:04:12,543
Come by tomorrow. I want
to take a look at it.

88
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:15,014
No need. I already know what it is.

89
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,733
Nathan's here.

90
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,959
She doesn't want to see him.

91
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:24,475
Yeah, I don't... I don't know.

92
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:28,579
Um, okay. Go take care of your patient.

93
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:29,834
I got this, okay?

94
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:32,147
And I'm good.

95
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:35,651
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!

96
00:04:35,656 --> 00:04:36,836
Is she okay?

97
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:39,053
She's fine. She's sleeping.

98
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:42,069
I wanna see her.

99
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,988
And you will, tomorrow.

100
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:45,296
Kristi's gonna sit with her tonight

101
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,647
and make sure everything is okay.

102
00:04:46,652 --> 00:04:48,327
No, no. I-I need to see her now, please.

103
00:04:48,332 --> 00:04:49,899
You will. Hey, hey.

104
00:04:50,437 --> 00:04:52,744
Is there anything else going
on that we should know about?

105
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,264
Anything that might help
Kristi figure out what's wrong?

106
00:04:57,507 --> 00:04:58,989
No. I'm just worried, that's all.

107
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:01,006
She's my little sister.

108
00:05:01,545 --> 00:05:03,913
Right. Look,

109
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,943
this is Kristi's first
night back since... right?

110
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:10,975
We don't want to be going in there

111
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,880
and making tonight more
stressful than it already is.

112
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:16,489
Sara's in good hands. Okay?

113
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:19,111
Go home. Get some sleep.

114
00:05:19,275 --> 00:05:20,798
You'll see her in the morning.

115
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:22,191
Yeah.

116
00:05:22,477 --> 00:05:23,956
Okay?

117
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:42,872
Is Sara gonna be okay?

118
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:45,616
Well, yeah, she's down at the clinic.

119
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:47,864
They're gonna take good
care of her. Don't worry.

120
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,349
You remember Kristi?

121
00:05:49,872 --> 00:05:51,966
The nice lady who took care of your leg?

122
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:55,312
She's gonna patch up Sara
the same way she patched you up.

123
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:58,005
In the meantime,

124
00:05:58,656 --> 00:06:01,747
we are gonna play a little game.

125
00:06:02,302 --> 00:06:03,497
For you.

126
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,739
Well, we said we're gonna
figure it out, right?

127
00:06:06,744 --> 00:06:09,349
Let's figure it out. Follow me.

128
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,937
We're gonna do some problem-solving,

129
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:20,032
and the way you problem solve

130
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:21,690
is by asking questions.

131
00:06:22,072 --> 00:06:24,364
You ask every question that might apply,

132
00:06:24,369 --> 00:06:27,091
no matter how crazy,
no matter how unlikely.

133
00:06:27,556 --> 00:06:29,849
You put it up on a board,
you get it out in front of you

134
00:06:29,854 --> 00:06:32,082
so that you can identify
everything you know

135
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:34,089
and everything you don't.

136
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:36,981
It'll be like telling a story.

137
00:06:36,986 --> 00:06:40,599
Right, buddy? Question number one.

138
00:06:43,093 --> 00:06:44,528
Dad!

139
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:47,583
What? You never wanted
to write on a wall?

140
00:06:54,107 --> 00:06:57,237
_

141
00:06:57,242 --> 00:07:00,724
There. That's where we begin.

142
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:46,634
_

143
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:48,299
Hey.

144
00:09:50,697 --> 00:09:52,267
I can't sleep.

145
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:56,939
Uh, yeah, me neither. I thought
you'd like some tea?

146
00:09:57,323 --> 00:09:59,064
Do you want some?

147
00:10:00,737 --> 00:10:01,737
Sure.

148
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,752
You and Kenny make a really cute couple.

149
00:10:11,757 --> 00:10:14,521
Oh, uh, no, we're just...

150
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:15,876
We're just friends.

151
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:17,699
Why?

152
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,861
He's really sweet, and he loves you.

153
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:23,314
It's complicated.

154
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:24,830
How?

155
00:10:24,835 --> 00:10:27,751
Well, 'cause I...

156
00:10:29,158 --> 00:10:30,916
have somebody at home.

157
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:36,306
At least I think
she's... still... waiting.

158
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,150
What's her name?

159
00:10:39,827 --> 00:10:41,361
Mariel.

160
00:10:41,915 --> 00:10:44,831
- Were you married?
- Engaged.

161
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:48,588
I wonder sometimes,
actually all the time, uh,

162
00:10:48,593 --> 00:10:52,923
what it must be like for her,
thinking I, uh, abandoned her.

163
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:56,588
Um, how about you?

164
00:10:56,593 --> 00:10:58,588
Do you have anybody back at home?

165
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,017
No.

166
00:11:01,742 --> 00:11:03,650
I... I was with someone,

167
00:11:03,655 --> 00:11:07,298
but he wasn't...

168
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,708
It's better that he's
not around anymore.

169
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:16,287
It's just me and Nathan now.

170
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,122
He's all I've got in the world.

171
00:11:19,714 --> 00:11:23,283
Before we got stuck here, I, um...

172
00:11:24,531 --> 00:11:26,989
Things weren't really very good for me.

173
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:31,038
Nathan was the one who saved me.

174
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,167
Can I ask you something?

175
00:11:35,298 --> 00:11:36,833
Yeah. Sure.

176
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,911
If there was something you could do,

177
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:46,541
something that would let
you see Mariel again...

178
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:51,074
something that would let
everyone here go home,

179
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,768
even if it was something bad,

180
00:11:54,734 --> 00:11:56,170
would you do it?

181
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,472
Wait, what are you talking about?

182
00:11:59,477 --> 00:12:03,830
I wonder sometimes... about this place,

183
00:12:04,345 --> 00:12:06,315
what it means...

184
00:12:07,557 --> 00:12:10,416
why we're here.

185
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,779
If someone came up to
you right now and said,

186
00:12:15,104 --> 00:12:18,254
"Do this one bad thing

187
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:21,213
and everyone gets to go home,"

188
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:23,854
would you do it?

189
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:26,854
Well, we're...

190
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,131
we're speaking hypothetically, right?

191
00:12:30,738 --> 00:12:33,704
- Yeah. Of course.
- Okay.

192
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,232
Okay.

193
00:12:35,612 --> 00:12:36,743
Uh...

194
00:12:38,997 --> 00:12:40,955
I mean...

195
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:44,900
Yeah, I'd, um...

196
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:47,151
I'd do anything to see her again and...

197
00:12:47,993 --> 00:12:49,549
And hey, I mean,

198
00:12:49,554 --> 00:12:51,434
if that meant everybody
else got to go home too,

199
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:54,812
then, I think that's a lot of good

200
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:57,940
for one bad thing.

201
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,998
Yeah.

202
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,189
Hmm.

203
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:15,019
Tell me you figured it out.

204
00:13:15,484 --> 00:13:17,443
Oh, I-I did.

205
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,596
And the answer is 12.

206
00:13:21,237 --> 00:13:22,884
Okay.

207
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:25,551
All right, let's go over this again.

208
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,955
Everyone enters from
different parts of the country,

209
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:33,885
on different roads, in different places,

210
00:13:34,593 --> 00:13:37,376
and they all, presumably,
see the same tree,

211
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:38,471
same crows.

212
00:13:38,476 --> 00:13:40,086
Jim, Jim...

213
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:44,752
everyone here has asked the same
question over and over again.

214
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,409
How does writing them on the wall

215
00:13:47,414 --> 00:13:48,612
going to make any difference?

216
00:13:48,617 --> 00:13:50,880
Because...

217
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:53,776
There are plenty of things in
the world that don't make sense.

218
00:13:53,781 --> 00:13:54,956
Yeah.

219
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,184
Something here is missing.

220
00:13:58,202 --> 00:14:00,276
We just can't see it yet.

221
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:02,575
But we will.

222
00:14:02,815 --> 00:14:04,995
Well, there's a question
we haven't asked.

223
00:14:17,894 --> 00:14:19,418
No.

224
00:14:20,088 --> 00:14:21,776
Why not?

225
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:26,017
Because it's crazy.

226
00:14:29,906 --> 00:14:31,777
I don't want to know the answer.

227
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,166
You sure you're not hungry?
I was gonna make some oatmeal.

228
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,563
I'm not really hungry.

229
00:14:43,051 --> 00:14:44,573
Thank you for last night, though.

230
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:47,182
It's been a long time since
I've had a girls' night.

231
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:48,926
Yeah, uh, me too.

232
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:51,755
I mean, hey, no need to
wait for a medical emergency

233
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,213
if you ever wanna do it again.

234
00:14:55,424 --> 00:14:57,078
Oh, your brother's back.

235
00:14:57,717 --> 00:15:00,633
Uh, he's very persistent.

236
00:15:00,638 --> 00:15:02,526
Yeah, he is.

237
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,868
Are you... are you sure you're okay?

238
00:15:04,873 --> 00:15:08,271
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.
He just... he cares a lot.

239
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:09,955
- Yeah.
- I'll see you later.

240
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:14,377
You're up bright and early.

241
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,475
Sara, we need to talk.

242
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,612
About what?

243
00:15:19,341 --> 00:15:22,802
I'm so sorry I worried
you. I didn't mean to.

244
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:24,875
It's fine. I just need
to know what happened.

245
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:26,659
I was just...

246
00:15:27,104 --> 00:15:29,385
I was standing in the diner one minute

247
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,837
and the next, I was on the floor.

248
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:32,801
I don't really remember
much other than that.

249
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,841
Why are you suddenly acting
like everything's okay?

250
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:35,925
I need to get to the diner.

251
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:37,213
Mrs. Liu is gonna be worried.

252
00:15:37,218 --> 00:15:38,350
Sara!

253
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:41,213
I'm okay, I promise.

254
00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:43,370
I love you so much.

255
00:15:52,848 --> 00:15:54,838
Knock, knock. You awake in there?

256
00:15:55,993 --> 00:15:57,518
Yeah, come on in.

257
00:15:57,913 --> 00:15:59,354
Whatcha doing?

258
00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:02,159
I'm making a list.

259
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:04,257
Of?

260
00:16:04,654 --> 00:16:05,785
All the people that are probably

261
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:07,312
wondering where we are right now.

262
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:09,137
Oh.

263
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:11,232
I mean, it's gotta be
worse for them, right?

264
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:13,842
Not knowing.

265
00:16:13,893 --> 00:16:15,452
Just...

266
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,416
I made one too.

267
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:24,979
Pretty sure everybody here
did at one time or another.

268
00:16:28,016 --> 00:16:29,974
Who's on yours?

269
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:35,406
My grandparents and my friends.

270
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:39,384
Boyfriend?

271
00:16:39,643 --> 00:16:40,912
No.

272
00:16:41,026 --> 00:16:42,135
Girlfriend?

273
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,291
No, there's nobody like that.

274
00:16:46,946 --> 00:16:49,213
I guess that's a good
thing though, right?

275
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:51,760
Just one less person sitting
around losing their minds,

276
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:53,593
wondering where you are.

277
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:57,333
Okay. That's enough of that.

278
00:16:57,338 --> 00:16:59,665
We need some fun, stat.

279
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,705
Get dressed and meet
me downstairs in five?

280
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,929
Why?

281
00:17:03,018 --> 00:17:04,018
You'll see.

282
00:17:12,721 --> 00:17:13,766
Hey.

283
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:15,127
Hey.

284
00:17:15,132 --> 00:17:17,362
No more work this morning.

285
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:20,354
She's, uh, making the list.

286
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:26,601
I think it's time we show
her the Brundles.

287
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:32,786
Just a fucking idiot.
That's special relativity.

288
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,792
Uh... Klein.

289
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:38,268
Hardy's. Klein. Hardy's.

290
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:42,665
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen.

291
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,367
Where are you going with that?

292
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:48,497
Sorry?

293
00:17:48,628 --> 00:17:50,847
Is that a radio?

294
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,432
Uh... yeah. Sort of.

295
00:17:54,437 --> 00:17:56,580
Why are you carrying it around?

296
00:18:00,002 --> 00:18:02,362
Because it helps me think.

297
00:18:03,105 --> 00:18:04,121
I'm sorry, I...

298
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:05,736
You're even cuter when you're awake.

299
00:18:05,992 --> 00:18:07,299
Excuse me?

300
00:18:07,304 --> 00:18:09,306
I watched you when you were sleeping.

301
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,085
I'm Trudy.

302
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:13,252
Okay.

303
00:18:14,488 --> 00:18:16,316
Too bad you chose the town.

304
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:22,252
I would've rode you
like an alabaster dragon.

305
00:18:24,243 --> 00:18:25,331
Bye!

306
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:43,513
Morning, Sheriff.

307
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:46,782
I stopped by the diner, let
my mom know that Sara was okay,

308
00:18:47,018 --> 00:18:48,605
and she made those bread
things that you like,

309
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:50,901
so I picked up a couple of those.

310
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:54,558
Uh, Sheriff?

311
00:18:57,641 --> 00:19:00,252
I'm gonna need you to hold
down the fort for a bit.

312
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:02,799
Is everything okay?

313
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:05,299
Everything's fine.

314
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,573
I'm gonna visit my wife.

315
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,639
It's been a while.

316
00:19:14,844 --> 00:19:15,932
Okay?

317
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:17,526
Yeah, sure.

318
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:27,474
What the hell?

319
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:30,205
You guys built a bar
in this fucking place?

320
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,904
Yeah. You end up in a place like this,

321
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:34,173
you ask yourself, what
do the people need?

322
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,736
Turns out it's not a fucking
gas station, so I figured...

323
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:42,705
Hey, you okay?

324
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,159
What?

325
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:46,502
Are... you... okay?

326
00:19:46,507 --> 00:19:49,205
No, no, I'm not... okay.

327
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:52,479
Are you okay?

328
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,399
Great. Here, drink this.

329
00:19:54,404 --> 00:19:56,059
It'll help you feel better.

330
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:57,979
What the fuck? How are you...

331
00:19:57,984 --> 00:20:01,286
Why are you all just sitting here?

332
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,601
Holy fuck! What is this shit?

333
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,690
Just consider it your
poor man's potato vodka.

334
00:20:16,987 --> 00:20:19,169
You're one of the guys
from the two cars, huh?

335
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:24,862
Your, uh, friend,
uh... friend got, uh...

336
00:20:25,948 --> 00:20:27,948
Yeah. Yeah.

337
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:31,312
Look, if it's any consolation, it...

338
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:34,049
It gets easier, man, it really does.

339
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,302
Gets easier, that's rich.

340
00:20:38,307 --> 00:20:39,955
That is fucking rich.

341
00:20:41,815 --> 00:20:45,601
You know, you guys are...
You're like rats in a maze,

342
00:20:46,116 --> 00:20:50,425
sitting there, contentedly...

343
00:20:50,734 --> 00:20:52,606
nibbling on your cheese.

344
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,221
This is a paradox.

345
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:01,576
That's the problem.

346
00:21:05,312 --> 00:21:07,791
The immediate question is,
how do we get home, right?

347
00:21:07,796 --> 00:21:11,643
How do we get out?
How do we get out of here?

348
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:15,747
'Cause unless we know where "here" is,

349
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:17,183
we can't get outta here.

350
00:21:17,188 --> 00:21:20,061
It's like... it's like...
this, it's like, uh,

351
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:22,026
hitting a bull's-eye with
your eyes closed, right?

352
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,635
You're just throwing 'em blind!

353
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,236
You don't even fucking know
where the fucking target is!

354
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:27,977
Maybe it's over here! I don't know!

355
00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:29,253
Maybe it just, like, went that way!

356
00:21:29,257 --> 00:21:31,644
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Come on!
- Throwing it!

357
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:33,479
Settle down.

358
00:21:33,484 --> 00:21:35,551
Eventually, you just
get tired, you give up.

359
00:21:36,021 --> 00:21:38,832
You accept that you can't just get out,

360
00:21:38,837 --> 00:21:40,113
'cause you have no fucking idea

361
00:21:40,118 --> 00:21:41,247
where you're trying to get out of.

362
00:21:41,251 --> 00:21:45,255
So, you sit around drinking
your acidic potato piss water

363
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,914
that you call vodka.

364
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:48,007
Yeah.

365
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:50,316
So, let me guess,

366
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:52,769
you're gonna be the guy
who figures it all out.

367
00:21:52,774 --> 00:21:54,732
You're goddamn right I am.

368
00:21:54,737 --> 00:21:57,215
People like me, we design the maze,

369
00:21:57,544 --> 00:21:59,957
we place the cheese.

370
00:22:00,455 --> 00:22:02,675
I don't know what you
did before you got here,

371
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,660
but I just sold a company
for an obscene amount of money

372
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:08,278
based on a quantum computing algorithm

373
00:22:08,283 --> 00:22:10,720
with the potential to...

374
00:22:12,543 --> 00:22:14,240
I'm not supposed to be here.

375
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:17,118
I'm supposed to be
celebrating right now at...

376
00:22:19,614 --> 00:22:21,020
Look, the point is we
can't get out of here

377
00:22:21,024 --> 00:22:22,755
unless we know where "here" is.

378
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:26,297
Right? To solve the paradox,
you gotta understand the paradox.

379
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:27,708
You gotta identify it.
You gotta frame it.

380
00:22:27,712 --> 00:22:30,541
- Schrodinger's cat.
- What?

381
00:22:30,546 --> 00:22:32,896
Schrodinger's cat,
that... that's the paradox.

382
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:36,269
You put the cat in the
box and you close the box.

383
00:22:36,274 --> 00:22:37,754
As long as you never open it again...

384
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:40,238
The cat is theoretically alive
and dead at the same time.

385
00:22:40,243 --> 00:22:42,691
I know what Schrodinger's cat is.

386
00:22:43,284 --> 00:22:46,199
Okay, so, we're the cat.

387
00:22:46,505 --> 00:22:49,465
This place here is the box, right?

388
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:54,788
So, all those people we
left behind back home?

389
00:22:55,382 --> 00:22:56,766
Well, they're all
sitting around wondering

390
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,772
if we're alive or dead.

391
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:02,341
So, to them, we're both
things at the same time.

392
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,689
I taught Intro to Philosophy at USC.

393
00:23:08,812 --> 00:23:10,187
Hmm.

394
00:23:10,192 --> 00:23:13,171
Look, uh, I don't know
a fuckin' thing about computers,

395
00:23:13,176 --> 00:23:14,917
I'll be the first to admit that.

396
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:17,093
But that, uh... that
radio you brought in,

397
00:23:17,098 --> 00:23:19,851
well, if you're so goddamn smart,

398
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,096
why don't you figure out how
to get it broadcasting, huh?

399
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,437
And I'll tell you what,

400
00:23:25,296 --> 00:23:28,476
if the cat turns on the radio,

401
00:23:28,481 --> 00:23:31,835
you can be goddamn sure that
the people outside the box

402
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,364
are at least gonna
know it's still alive.

403
00:23:38,137 --> 00:23:39,913
Huh.

404
00:24:01,827 --> 00:24:03,742
Are you sure this doesn't hurt?

405
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:06,315
It's just a little sore.

406
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:08,723
Hm.

407
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:10,082
What's wrong?

408
00:24:10,087 --> 00:24:12,316
Nothing. It's...

409
00:24:15,492 --> 00:24:17,113
It's just...

410
00:24:17,118 --> 00:24:19,488
It's just healing so fast.

411
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,801
Is that bad?

412
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:24,652
No. No.

413
00:24:24,657 --> 00:24:27,050
Um, actually, it's very good.

414
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:30,074
I think this place is special.

415
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:33,254
I know it tries to hurt people,

416
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:36,431
but maybe it tries to help people too.

417
00:24:36,816 --> 00:24:39,551
Maybe that can be one of
the questions on the wall.

418
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:41,922
What would that be?

419
00:24:41,974 --> 00:24:45,647
Is there anyone trying to help?

420
00:24:48,525 --> 00:24:50,694
That's a great question.

421
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:53,027
Ethan! You have a visitor!

422
00:24:53,363 --> 00:24:55,875
Oh. Let's see who that is.

423
00:24:58,053 --> 00:24:59,620
Sara!

424
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,832
How's my favorite customer?

425
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:03,893
We drew on the walls.

426
00:25:03,898 --> 00:25:05,527
I see that.

427
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:08,942
We never draw on the walls at home.

428
00:25:11,287 --> 00:25:12,731
How are you feeling?

429
00:25:12,736 --> 00:25:14,184
Much better, thank you.

430
00:25:14,189 --> 00:25:17,147
Good. Uh, did Kristi
figure out what happened?

431
00:25:17,152 --> 00:25:19,300
Not yet. It's...

432
00:25:19,531 --> 00:25:21,402
It's just one of those things, I guess.

433
00:25:21,407 --> 00:25:24,027
- Yeah.
- There's a playground outside.

434
00:25:24,031 --> 00:25:25,691
Wanna see?

435
00:25:25,696 --> 00:25:27,918
Hey, honey, Sara just
came out of the hospital.

436
00:25:27,923 --> 00:25:30,353
- Sure.
- Okay.

437
00:25:30,358 --> 00:25:33,879
- Yeah. It's okay, really.
- Yeah.

438
00:25:33,884 --> 00:25:35,996
- Come on!
- Be careful.

439
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,902
This one's my favorite.

440
00:26:11,982 --> 00:26:13,420
Hello?

441
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:19,578
Father Khatri?

442
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:33,026
Welcome to the Brundles!

443
00:26:34,456 --> 00:26:36,342
Whoo!

444
00:26:36,885 --> 00:26:38,670
Oh, God!

445
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:42,212
Oh!

446
00:26:45,425 --> 00:26:47,383
See? If you close your eyes

447
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:48,911
and just listen,

448
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:52,209
it's almost like being
anywhere else in the world.

449
00:26:52,706 --> 00:26:54,357
How do you do that?

450
00:26:54,943 --> 00:26:56,334
Do what?

451
00:26:57,145 --> 00:26:59,529
How do you act like
this place doesn't...

452
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:02,357
You're always so positive.

453
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,124
I guess it all just depends on
how you choose to look at it.

454
00:27:07,424 --> 00:27:08,865
What do you mean?

455
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,716
Well, I didn't come to
the U.S. until I was 11.

456
00:27:16,232 --> 00:27:18,762
I grew up in a small village in Iran

457
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:20,779
with my parents and two older brothers.

458
00:27:21,096 --> 00:27:25,884
My father, he was a
very outspoken cleric,

459
00:27:25,889 --> 00:27:30,102
which wasn't always the most
popular thing to be at the time.

460
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,298
One day, it was my birthday.

461
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:37,110
Actually, we were getting
ready to go see my uncle.

462
00:27:37,538 --> 00:27:42,063
These men showed up.
They were angry, shouting.

463
00:27:42,248 --> 00:27:44,462
I remember my mother told me to hide.

464
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:49,509
But I was so confused
because we were just laughing.

465
00:27:50,245 --> 00:27:52,618
My father had told this story about...

466
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,154
He was a really good storyteller.

467
00:27:59,206 --> 00:28:01,962
I think that's what made him
such an effective preacher.

468
00:28:03,003 --> 00:28:06,407
Anyway, I could tell
my mother was afraid.

469
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:09,579
My brothers had run to the door
and now they were shouting too,

470
00:28:09,584 --> 00:28:13,414
and my mother just kept
saying "Hide, hide."

471
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:17,434
But I just stood there, I couldn't move,

472
00:28:17,977 --> 00:28:19,712
because it was all so strange.

473
00:28:19,717 --> 00:28:23,720
I mean, we were just
laughing so hard, you know?

474
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:26,602
It was gonna be the best birthday ever.

475
00:28:26,607 --> 00:28:29,196
The sun was so bright
coming in through the door

476
00:28:29,201 --> 00:28:31,769
that my father became a silhouette

477
00:28:31,774 --> 00:28:33,556
when they dragged him outside.

478
00:28:39,178 --> 00:28:41,415
And then, there was this pop,

479
00:28:43,242 --> 00:28:45,079
like a firecracker,

480
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:48,412
and the silhouette fell down.

481
00:28:51,215 --> 00:28:52,956
Oh, my God.

482
00:28:55,641 --> 00:28:57,516
The point is,

483
00:28:58,694 --> 00:29:01,431
there are always going to
be monsters in the world.

484
00:29:01,436 --> 00:29:03,308
It doesn't matter where you are.

485
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:05,602
But I promised myself

486
00:29:05,622 --> 00:29:08,494
I would never let them
scare the life out of me.

487
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,899
- Oh, hey, hi.
- Hi!

488
00:29:11,904 --> 00:29:14,446
Ah, yeah, you just
look too dry. Come here!

489
00:29:14,451 --> 00:29:17,838
Oh, no, no, no! No, no, no, no!

490
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:19,681
Come on. Yup, we're goin'!

491
00:29:19,686 --> 00:29:22,274
We're goin'! Hey!

492
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:24,148
Julie, come on!

493
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:25,918
Come on!

494
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:32,455
That's the most like himself

495
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,376
I've seen Ethan since the accident.

496
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:38,477
How long have you lived here?

497
00:29:39,314 --> 00:29:41,050
Just a few months.

498
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:43,433
Mom and Dad are trying
to figure out where we are

499
00:29:43,438 --> 00:29:45,092
so we can all go home.

500
00:29:45,348 --> 00:29:47,958
That's what the Cromenockle would do.

501
00:29:47,963 --> 00:29:49,526
What's a Cromenockle?

502
00:29:49,969 --> 00:29:51,939
She's a sweet girl.

503
00:29:55,941 --> 00:29:58,622
Hey, honey. Don't make her sit there.

504
00:29:58,627 --> 00:30:00,010
Those things are filthy.

505
00:30:00,015 --> 00:30:02,994
It's okay. It's...
it's actually kinda fun.

506
00:30:03,211 --> 00:30:06,911
Sara said we can go see
the goats and chickens at the barn.

507
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,181
Really?

508
00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:10,494
My brother, he tends to all
the animals for the town.

509
00:30:10,499 --> 00:30:12,494
I thought it might be fun to show Ethan.

510
00:30:12,499 --> 00:30:14,370
It's just down the street.

511
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:17,307
Do you want to go?
I'm gonna tell Dad we're going.

512
00:30:17,312 --> 00:30:19,271
I can take him.

513
00:30:19,643 --> 00:30:20,727
I don't want to take you guys away

514
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:22,429
from anything that you're doing.

515
00:30:22,434 --> 00:30:24,523
We're not doing anything. Hey, Jim,

516
00:30:24,528 --> 00:30:26,182
I'll be right back.

517
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:28,348
Okay.

518
00:30:40,766 --> 00:30:42,637
Hey, babe.

519
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:46,323
It's been a while.

520
00:30:47,454 --> 00:30:49,651
Things have been...

521
00:30:50,396 --> 00:30:53,660
they've been a little
crazy past few days.

522
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,424
Those, uh, things...

523
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:59,002
they, uh...

524
00:31:00,481 --> 00:31:03,283
they got into the house
where the little girl lived,

525
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,776
got into the clinic.

526
00:31:08,321 --> 00:31:10,612
You know, we were doing
pretty good for a while there,

527
00:31:10,617 --> 00:31:12,097
keeping everything together.

528
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:15,135
It was almost starting to feel like...

529
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:27,674
Uh...

530
00:31:28,743 --> 00:31:32,299
I started getting tremors
in my hand a few weeks back,

531
00:31:34,408 --> 00:31:36,143
same way it started with my Dad,

532
00:31:36,148 --> 00:31:38,934
which means the clock
is officially ticking.

533
00:31:39,952 --> 00:31:42,838
But, see, uh...

534
00:31:43,804 --> 00:31:46,729
I have this crazy idea
that might actually work,

535
00:31:46,734 --> 00:31:48,705
and-and if it does,

536
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:52,931
then I might be able to find
a way to get these people home,

537
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:55,823
to get Ellis home.

538
00:31:57,896 --> 00:32:02,119
Of course if it doesn't,
if I'm wrong or if I fail,

539
00:32:02,124 --> 00:32:03,705
then, uh...

540
00:32:04,528 --> 00:32:06,608
then I'm leaving these
people in a worse-off position

541
00:32:06,613 --> 00:32:08,393
than they already are.

542
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,182
You were always the one...

543
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:18,643
You made all the hard calls.

544
00:32:18,648 --> 00:32:21,033
"Sometimes you got to swing big, baby."

545
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:23,806
'Member that?

546
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,374
God, you had...

547
00:32:33,212 --> 00:32:35,557
I do this

548
00:32:36,143 --> 00:32:38,995
and that's about as big
a swing as I can take.

549
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,846
And, um...

550
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:43,744
And look, I know, I know, I always said

551
00:32:43,749 --> 00:32:48,011
that I don't believe in signs
or any of that stuff, but...

552
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:53,623
I could really use one right now, okay?

553
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:57,974
'Cause, babe, I'm standing at the plate,

554
00:32:59,162 --> 00:33:01,873
and I'll swing if you
tell me to swing. I just...

555
00:33:06,811 --> 00:33:08,966
Babe, I just need a little help here.

556
00:33:08,971 --> 00:33:10,451
Come on.

557
00:33:11,463 --> 00:33:13,334
I need a sign.

558
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:22,840
Father Khatri?

559
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:27,130
Nathan.

560
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:29,826
Have you come up here much?

561
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:32,314
No, not really.

562
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,929
It's strange, don't you think?

563
00:33:34,451 --> 00:33:36,365
A place like this...

564
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,787
could exist in a place like this?

565
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:44,951
Um...

566
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:50,230
I was wondering, what are the rules?

567
00:33:50,893 --> 00:33:54,396
When it comes to confession,

568
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:57,607
if I tell you something,

569
00:33:57,612 --> 00:34:00,013
does it stay between the two of us?

570
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:02,542
Anything you tell me
stays between us and God.

571
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,424
What if it's bad?

572
00:34:08,999 --> 00:34:10,871
What if it's really bad?

573
00:34:12,615 --> 00:34:15,196
- That one's name is Alma.
- Hi, Alma.

574
00:34:16,837 --> 00:34:19,083
Oh, this is so much fun. Thank you.

575
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,771
It's my pleasure.

576
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:24,135
Really, he's a little sweetheart.

577
00:34:24,866 --> 00:34:26,172
Yeah.

578
00:34:26,616 --> 00:34:28,879
You have a really nice family.

579
00:34:29,487 --> 00:34:31,156
Hmm.

580
00:34:32,686 --> 00:34:35,643
It's okay to be sad, you know?

581
00:34:37,314 --> 00:34:39,315
And it's okay to be afraid.

582
00:34:42,661 --> 00:34:43,963
Yeah, it seems the one thing

583
00:34:43,968 --> 00:34:46,190
that everyone in this town agrees on.

584
00:34:48,776 --> 00:34:50,735
Really, though, you'd be surprised

585
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,265
how quickly all this becomes normal.

586
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,127
I don't want this to become normal.

587
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,405
I just want to go back home.

588
00:35:04,824 --> 00:35:06,237
Me too.

589
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:10,143
At least we have the talismans, though.

590
00:35:10,586 --> 00:35:12,284
Father Khatri always talks about

591
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:13,758
how much worse it was for people.

592
00:35:13,763 --> 00:35:16,331
They'd just hide in places after dark,

593
00:35:16,336 --> 00:35:18,369
hoping the monsters wouldn't find them.

594
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:20,983
Those hiding places are all over town.

595
00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:23,033
It's really good to know about them,

596
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,908
just in case you ever get
stuck outside after dark.

597
00:35:25,913 --> 00:35:27,604
Yeah, I guess.

598
00:35:28,063 --> 00:35:31,200
There's one in the barn.
I can show you where it is.

599
00:35:31,205 --> 00:35:32,734
Really?

600
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:35,800
Yeah, it's just... It's right inside.

601
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:38,815
Uh, yeah.

602
00:35:40,642 --> 00:35:43,993
Honey, uh, I'll be right
back, okay? Don't move.

603
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:45,666
This way.

604
00:35:55,837 --> 00:35:59,979
Nathan, you should've
come to me much sooner.

605
00:35:59,984 --> 00:36:02,291
I didn't... Wait, wait.

606
00:36:02,296 --> 00:36:03,487
What's gonna happen to her?

607
00:36:03,492 --> 00:36:05,510
I don't want her to go in the box.

608
00:36:06,127 --> 00:36:07,377
You gave your word.

609
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:08,877
And I intend to keep it.

610
00:36:08,882 --> 00:36:11,599
But right now, we have to worry
about the people of the town.

611
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:12,779
She'll be at the diner.

612
00:36:12,784 --> 00:36:15,429
Okay. Come on. Let's go.

613
00:36:43,845 --> 00:36:46,032
People used to spend the night in here?

614
00:36:46,669 --> 00:36:48,360
What are you doing? Sara!

615
00:36:48,365 --> 00:36:50,469
- Sorry, Tabitha.
- Open up!

616
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,172
I'm sorry. I'm doing this for you.

617
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:53,602
I'm doing this for all of us.

618
00:36:53,607 --> 00:36:57,050
Why are you sorry?
Just open the door, please!

619
00:36:57,055 --> 00:36:58,646
- I'm sorry.
- Sara!

620
00:36:59,032 --> 00:37:02,211
Sara! Sara!

621
00:37:05,277 --> 00:37:07,062
Go get your sister.

622
00:37:09,654 --> 00:37:11,177
Father Khatri!

623
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:17,547
Hey, I've got kind of a
weird question for you.

624
00:37:18,491 --> 00:37:19,946
If, uh...

625
00:37:21,512 --> 00:37:25,110
If someone asked for a sign,

626
00:37:25,954 --> 00:37:29,016
how would they know what
they were looking for?

627
00:37:33,115 --> 00:37:34,464
Sara?

628
00:37:34,595 --> 00:37:35,857
Looking for your sister?

629
00:37:36,474 --> 00:37:37,518
Yeah.

630
00:37:37,899 --> 00:37:39,214
She's not here.

631
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:40,368
I saw her heading towards the barn

632
00:37:40,372 --> 00:37:41,812
with that Matthews lady and her boy.

633
00:38:03,672 --> 00:38:05,544
Where's my mom?

634
00:38:05,548 --> 00:38:07,550
She'll be right out.

635
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:10,102
Come here.

636
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,184
I need to tell you something.

637
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:15,395
Sara!

638
00:38:15,643 --> 00:38:18,219
Ethan! Sara!

639
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,430
I really like you.

640
00:38:21,435 --> 00:38:23,611
And what's about to happen,

641
00:38:24,782 --> 00:38:27,044
it's gonna save everyone,

642
00:38:28,008 --> 00:38:30,461
just like in one of your stories.

643
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,911
You're gonna be the hero.

644
00:38:35,196 --> 00:38:37,175
Where's my Mom? I want my Mom!

645
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,469
- We're doing this for her!
- Sara!

646
00:38:39,474 --> 00:38:41,918
- Sara, what are you doing?
- This is how we go home.

647
00:38:41,923 --> 00:38:43,098
Let him go.

648
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:44,711
They told me, this was the last one,

649
00:38:44,716 --> 00:38:46,790
then everyone gets to go home!

650
00:38:47,049 --> 00:38:49,182
Ethan! Sara!

651
00:38:51,305 --> 00:38:52,714
Ethan, run!

652
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:54,979
No! Let me go!

653
00:38:54,984 --> 00:38:57,335
You don't understand!

654
00:38:59,076 --> 00:39:01,774
Oh, my God, Ethan! Ethan!

655
00:39:02,669 --> 00:39:04,323
Nathan?

656
00:39:04,606 --> 00:39:05,979
Nathan?

657
00:39:07,354 --> 00:39:08,732
Nathan!

658
00:39:09,742 --> 00:39:11,705
No!

659
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,650
No, Nathan!

660
00:39:13,655 --> 00:39:15,997
- Nathan.
- Nathan, please!

661
00:39:16,002 --> 00:39:17,083
Nathan!

662
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,275
Nathan! Nathan!

663
00:39:21,036 --> 00:39:24,574
Nathan! No! My God, please!

664
00:39:25,395 --> 00:39:27,457
Please, Nath...

665
00:39:34,552 --> 00:39:37,112
You guys are right.
It's not all bad here.

666
00:39:39,903 --> 00:39:41,940
You know, I was thinking, when
we get back to the house...

667
00:39:41,944 --> 00:39:43,903
- Julie!
- What?

668
00:39:44,196 --> 00:39:46,030
Hey. Ethan?

669
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:47,138
- Hey.
- Julie!

670
00:39:47,142 --> 00:39:48,752
Hey, hey, hey. What's wrong?

671
00:39:48,757 --> 00:39:50,280
Where's Mom and Dad?

672
00:39:50,775 --> 00:39:52,080
Hey, what's wrong?

673
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:53,685
It's okay. Don't cry.

674
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:56,780
Come here. Come here.
Come here. It's okay. Shh.

675
00:39:58,622 --> 00:40:00,132
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

676
00:40:00,137 --> 00:40:01,524
Oh, my God! Ethan!

677
00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:02,748
Tabitha!

678
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:04,135
Ethan!

679
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:06,834
Help me!

680
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:09,749
Please help me!

681
00:40:09,754 --> 00:40:11,070
Help me out here, please!

682
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,227
Tabitha! Tabitha!

683
00:40:14,316 --> 00:40:17,192
- Jim! Jim, over here!
- You okay?

684
00:40:17,197 --> 00:40:18,242
Where... where's Ethan?

685
00:40:18,247 --> 00:40:19,254
- What?
- Where's Ethan?!

686
00:40:19,259 --> 00:40:21,130
Go and find him!

687
00:40:22,986 --> 00:40:25,734
Ethan! Ethan!

688
00:40:25,879 --> 00:40:26,960
Jim!

689
00:40:26,965 --> 00:40:28,296
- Mom!
- Jim, where's Ethan!?

690
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,310
- Dad!
- I don't know.

691
00:40:29,314 --> 00:40:30,567
- Where's Ethan?
- Mom!

692
00:40:30,572 --> 00:40:32,434
Oh, my God! Ethan.

693
00:40:33,174 --> 00:40:34,611
- Oh, my God!
- Here you go.

694
00:40:34,616 --> 00:40:35,957
Oh, my God!

695
00:40:38,111 --> 00:40:39,678
Come here, come here.

696
00:41:12,514 --> 00:41:13,676
- I was too late.
- Hold on.

697
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:15,037
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

698
00:41:15,182 --> 00:41:16,879
Jim. Tabitha.

699
00:41:20,096 --> 00:41:22,280
- How is he?
- He's fine. He's fine.

700
00:41:22,285 --> 00:41:23,482
- We're gonna go home.
- You go on ahead, okay?

701
00:41:23,486 --> 00:41:25,140
- Come on, Jules.
- I'll catch up.

702
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,910
Where is she?

703
00:41:31,762 --> 00:41:35,057
Uh, she, uh...
She ran off into the woods.

704
00:41:35,614 --> 00:41:36,926
And?

705
00:41:36,931 --> 00:41:40,195
And if she comes back before
dark, then we'll handle it.

706
00:41:41,535 --> 00:41:43,426
And if she doesn't?

707
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:46,285
If she doesn't, then it's handled.

708
00:41:49,052 --> 00:41:50,749
She came into my house.

709
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:53,633
She played with my kid.

710
00:41:54,332 --> 00:41:55,953
I know.

711
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:57,341
Look, if there's
anything that we can do...

712
00:41:57,345 --> 00:41:59,086
The fuck is wrong with you people?

713
00:41:59,472 --> 00:42:01,822
You talk like this place
is fucking Mayberry!

714
00:42:02,563 --> 00:42:05,174
One big family, is that what you said?

715
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:06,877
Are you fucking kidding me?

716
00:42:29,676 --> 00:42:31,373
Where did you find him?

717
00:42:32,187 --> 00:42:35,124
Um, we were just coming back...

718
00:42:35,717 --> 00:42:37,218
Well, it doesn't really matter.

719
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:40,296
But he was running up the hill
towards the Colony House.

720
00:42:40,301 --> 00:42:42,173
You did good, Julie.

721
00:42:50,436 --> 00:42:52,308
Can you take him upstairs for a minute?

722
00:42:53,186 --> 00:42:54,648
You wanna go upstairs?

723
00:42:54,689 --> 00:42:55,907
Hmm?

724
00:42:58,189 --> 00:42:59,960
Come on, bug!

725
00:42:59,965 --> 00:43:03,804
Let's go read the "Cromawhatsit."

726
00:43:03,809 --> 00:43:05,155
It's The Cromenockle.

727
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,476
Oh, yeah, sure.

728
00:43:06,481 --> 00:43:08,827
That's what I said the "Cromawhatsit."

729
00:43:09,281 --> 00:43:11,671
Come on. All right. Just take it slow.

730
00:43:11,676 --> 00:43:13,265
You're good.

731
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,945
Yeah. You got this.

732
00:43:25,306 --> 00:43:27,241
I need something to write with.

733
00:43:37,136 --> 00:43:39,399
Ask every question, right?

734
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,098
That's right.

735
00:43:58,225 --> 00:44:03,291
_

736
00:44:31,407 --> 00:44:32,678
Mind if I sit?

737
00:44:32,683 --> 00:44:33,684
Yeah.

738
00:44:36,275 --> 00:44:38,582
No. I mean, yeah, you can sit.

739
00:44:38,587 --> 00:44:40,241
I understood.

740
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:50,954
She just kept asking these questions,

741
00:44:50,959 --> 00:44:52,334
like...

742
00:44:53,442 --> 00:44:55,257
what I would do to go home.

743
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:56,704
Mm.

744
00:44:59,484 --> 00:45:01,116
I just had...

745
00:45:01,121 --> 00:45:03,350
It didn't cross my mind that, um...

746
00:45:03,355 --> 00:45:05,052
Listen. Listen to me.

747
00:45:08,018 --> 00:45:09,585
This is not your fault.

748
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:20,048
I spent the entire night with her,

749
00:45:20,053 --> 00:45:23,187
and it was just nice to sit and...

750
00:45:24,209 --> 00:45:26,561
talk and...

751
00:45:27,397 --> 00:45:29,419
have a good time, and...

752
00:45:30,229 --> 00:45:33,058
that scalpel she used,
she took it from my clinic.

753
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:36,496
So, if... it's not my fault,

754
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:38,997
then who...

755
00:45:40,351 --> 00:45:42,176
Whose is it?

756
00:45:43,939 --> 00:45:46,051
You did not bring us here.

757
00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:50,950
You did not put whatever
thought she had in her head.

758
00:45:52,848 --> 00:45:55,083
You're just trying to
do the best you can.

759
00:45:56,063 --> 00:45:58,587
And a few nights ago, hey, look,

760
00:45:58,592 --> 00:46:01,317
you saved a little boy's life,

761
00:46:03,967 --> 00:46:07,481
and you're gonna save more
lives before this is all done.

762
00:46:08,892 --> 00:46:10,763
Hey, hey.

763
00:46:12,305 --> 00:46:13,959
Look.

764
00:46:15,299 --> 00:46:17,512
I need you to do me a favor.

765
00:46:18,302 --> 00:46:23,263
Cut yourself some slack. Okay?

766
00:46:32,759 --> 00:46:34,226
I'll be damned.

767
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:38,299
What?

768
00:46:38,304 --> 00:46:39,759
What is it?

769
00:46:40,695 --> 00:46:42,970
? I'd go out on the ocean ?

770
00:46:43,758 --> 00:46:45,672
I just got my sign.

771
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:48,353
? I'd ride him on my boat ?

772
00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:50,879
? And we could all together ?

773
00:46:50,884 --> 00:46:53,290
? Go out on the ocean ?

774
00:46:53,295 --> 00:46:57,736
? I said, me upon my pony on my boat ?

775
00:46:57,868 --> 00:47:00,868
