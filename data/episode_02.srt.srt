00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:18,812
Previously on From...

2
00:00:18,838 --> 00:00:21,155
I'm sorry. This is the only way.

3
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,327
- Where am I?
- You're in Camden, Maine.

4
00:00:26,353 --> 00:00:29,609
Get the hell outta here. You deaf?
I said get the...

5
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,549
Where did you get that?

6
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:33,342
You're Victor's father.

7
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,344
I'm gonna go look for my wife.

8
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,343
Someone's gotta make sure that
Jim comes back in one piece.

9
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:38,866
I know what it's like
to lose a parent here,

10
00:00:38,892 --> 00:00:40,558
and I'm not gonna watch
Julie and Ethan lose

11
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,202
both their parents in the same week.

12
00:00:42,227 --> 00:00:44,069
- _
- Ma...

13
00:00:44,094 --> 00:00:45,616
_

14
00:00:46,804 --> 00:00:47,872
What the fuck?

15
00:00:47,898 --> 00:00:49,275
These look pretty solid.

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,152
We could just start from
here in the morning.

17
00:00:51,444 --> 00:00:53,653
- Just give me a second.
- Come on!

18
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,614
My stomach just hasn't been right.

19
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,450
Those animals are the only
food that we have now.

20
00:00:57,475 --> 00:01:01,780
They are a resource. We have
to make everything lasts!

21
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,179
There's goddamn cows in the street!

22
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,711
Get those smaller animals into the barn!

23
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,757
- Alma's outside!
- No! Go! Ethan, run!

24
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,591
Julie! Go!

25
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:20,148
Let's go! Come on!

26
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:22,452
- No, no, no! You go back!
- We do together!

27
00:01:24,906 --> 00:01:26,882
- No!
- Boyd!

28
00:01:26,907 --> 00:01:29,272
- Boyd!
- You think this place can't break you?

29
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:30,632
Let's see.

30
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:32,416
What the fuck?!

31
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:34,085
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

32
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,405
No, no, no, no, no, no!
I know, I know, I know!

33
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,695
I know! I know! I know!

34
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:02,393
Don't.

35
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,807
Somebody has to go and see.

36
00:02:23,415 --> 00:02:25,954
Oh, God. No, Jesus, no.

37
00:02:26,642 --> 00:02:27,723
Boyd.

38
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:29,023
Boyd!

39
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,602
Key.

40
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,790
Boyd.

41
00:02:39,156 --> 00:02:40,460
Where's the key?

42
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:43,157
In my pocket.

43
00:02:44,273 --> 00:02:46,102
They left it in my pocket.

44
00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:02,723
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry.

45
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,608
I'm so sorry!

46
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,956
I'm so sorry!

47
00:03:17,953 --> 00:03:19,432
Please...

48
00:03:19,988 --> 00:03:21,620
Please...

49
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:26,510
Kenny!

50
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,512
No. No.

51
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:33,895
You gotta come down here!

52
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,415
Look at this.

53
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:52,385
It's growing in patches
all around the lake.

54
00:03:54,998 --> 00:03:58,353
There's enough food here to feed
everybody in the entire town.

55
00:04:01,238 --> 00:04:02,470
Look.

56
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,817
www.subtitulamos.tv

57
00:06:23,044 --> 00:06:24,398
What happened?

58
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,008
Oh, no. It's okay.

59
00:06:30,226 --> 00:06:31,450
You...

60
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:34,719
You passed out on my front porch.

61
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:37,544
Maybe I should just...

62
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,137
You should sit.

63
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:43,246
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

64
00:06:43,606 --> 00:06:46,267
- I'm sorry.
- You showed up on my doorstep

65
00:06:46,293 --> 00:06:49,412
with the lunchbox my son

66
00:06:49,793 --> 00:06:51,520
left here with...

67
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:56,074
a very long time ago.

68
00:06:57,348 --> 00:07:00,437
You're gonna tell me how you found that,

69
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,107
and you're gonna tell me right now.

70
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,418
Okay.

71
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:07,824
Yeah.

72
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:09,316
Okay.

73
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:14,509
My name is Tabitha Matthews.

74
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:17,788
My family and I were on a road trip

75
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:19,907
to see some relatives in Colorado,

76
00:07:20,118 --> 00:07:22,572
when we had to take a
detour off the highway.

77
00:07:23,384 --> 00:07:25,415
There was a massive tree
in the middle of the road,

78
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:28,595
so we thought we were
just driving around it.

79
00:07:30,388 --> 00:07:32,164
But we never got back to the road.

80
00:07:33,446 --> 00:07:38,509
We kept driving, and we
got to this... town,

81
00:07:39,128 --> 00:07:41,689
a place that we couldn't leave.

82
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:44,337
But there were people there,

83
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,460
and some of them had
been there for a while.

84
00:07:46,486 --> 00:07:48,629
- I don't know how long they'd been...
- No, no!

85
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:51,577
Where did you get the lunchbox?

86
00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:53,999
Well, that's what I'm
trying to tell you.

87
00:07:54,025 --> 00:07:55,697
The place we ended up,

88
00:07:56,032 --> 00:07:58,853
there are people that had been
there for years, I mean, for...

89
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,306
Where did you get the lunchbox?!

90
00:08:01,332 --> 00:08:02,829
- He gave it to me!
- Who?

91
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,712
Your son. Victor. He gave it to me.

92
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:11,407
He gave it to you.

93
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,471
Yeah.

94
00:08:13,714 --> 00:08:14,806
When?

95
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:18,884
Three, four... Four days ago.

96
00:08:19,077 --> 00:08:20,697
Victor is alive.

97
00:08:20,723 --> 00:08:23,639
The town I was telling you about, he's
been stuck there all these years.

98
00:08:23,665 --> 00:08:25,105
Okay, all right.

99
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,733
If you won't talk to me, then
maybe you'll talk to the police.

100
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:31,570
No, sir. Please, please.
You can't call them.

101
00:08:31,735 --> 00:08:33,922
I can't tell them who I am.

102
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:37,763
If I try to explain any of this
to them, I'll sound crazy.

103
00:08:37,936 --> 00:08:39,852
When they ask where my family is...

104
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:44,014
what am I gonna tell them?
I don't know where they are.

105
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,876
Please, sir, you have to believe me.
Please don't call the police.

106
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:51,220
Well, Tabitha, I called the
police about 20 minutes ago.

107
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:52,876
They should be here any minute.

108
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:57,204
So, we're just gonna
sit here together...

109
00:08:57,478 --> 00:08:59,868
until they arrive.

110
00:09:04,307 --> 00:09:06,271
I know how to prove I'm not lying.

111
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:13,768
No.

112
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:16,030
You don't come in here. You understand?

113
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:18,553
Boyd might be okay with
everything you did,

114
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:21,081
- but if you think for a second...
- Tian-Chen died.

115
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:26,690
What?

116
00:09:27,971 --> 00:09:31,151
Something happened last night.
The animals...

117
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,252
got out into the street,

118
00:09:33,855 --> 00:09:35,064
and she...

119
00:09:37,464 --> 00:09:38,705
I didn't...

120
00:09:39,775 --> 00:09:43,698
I thought you would want to know,
and I wasn't sure if anyone...

121
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:47,882
I'm sorry.

122
00:09:55,648 --> 00:09:56,696
Kristi?

123
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,599
Who was that?

124
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:03,687
Baby?

125
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,523
Hey, what's wrong?

126
00:10:10,352 --> 00:10:11,523
What?

127
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:16,077
Kenny's mom died.

128
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,663
What?

129
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,980
Over there.

130
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:11,370
Okay.

131
00:11:30,213 --> 00:11:31,269
Okay.

132
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:53,895
Okay.

133
00:12:06,246 --> 00:12:08,224
Here. Okay.

134
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,517
We...

135
00:12:20,936 --> 00:12:22,281
We need to...

136
00:12:25,463 --> 00:12:29,376
We need to make sure she gets
buried with her husband.

137
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,642
She would have wanted that.

138
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:34,017
She wouldn't...

139
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:38,072
Right.
Yeah.

140
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,016
- Boyd.
- Yeah.

141
00:12:42,616 --> 00:12:45,218
You were in the barn with
her, with those things.

142
00:12:45,244 --> 00:12:46,245
Yeah.

143
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:49,741
How are you still alive?

144
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,207
They wanted me to watch.

145
00:12:56,463 --> 00:12:57,495
They...

146
00:12:58,784 --> 00:12:59,793
Yeah.

147
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,547
No! Let me go!

148
00:13:25,547 --> 00:13:27,086
Boyd!

149
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:30,461
Boyd!

150
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:51,299
Boyd!

151
00:13:53,202 --> 00:13:54,400
Boyd!

152
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:56,612
Is it true?

153
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:01,534
Oh, fuck.

154
00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:07,925
I wanna go see her.

155
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,706
I just I don't think that
a good idea right now, okay?

156
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:16,526
She's gonna be okay, right?
Kristi can fix her.

157
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,557
Ethan...

158
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,542
We should bring her her blanket.

159
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,923
She'll be more comfortable
when she has her blanket.

160
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:27,690
- I wanna go see her.
- It's okay.

161
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,346
Tell her that we have
to go see Tian-Chen!

162
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:33,518
That we have to help!

163
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:38,346
- I could use a little help in there.
- No.

164
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:40,461
I have to go.

165
00:14:40,487 --> 00:14:43,232
- You have to go?
- Yes, I have to go.

166
00:14:43,643 --> 00:14:45,151
- I'm talking to you!
- I have to go!

167
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,570
Wait! Where are you going?

168
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,446
- I can't stay here anymore.
- Why?

169
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,156
- Because!
- We have to help her!

170
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,117
We can't help her! She's dead!

171
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:54,203
She's dead, Ethan!

172
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:56,581
People die here!

173
00:14:56,868 --> 00:14:59,331
I told you that! It's not make-believe!

174
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,251
I told you that bad things happen here!

175
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,362
It's not my fault that
you didn't listen!

176
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,620
I have to go.

177
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,635
It's okay.

178
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:16,695
_

179
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:18,760
I mean, there's other
people you can look up.

180
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:21,562
Boyd Stevens. His family went missing.

181
00:15:22,627 --> 00:15:23,901
Donna.

182
00:15:24,498 --> 00:15:25,831
Donna...

183
00:15:27,378 --> 00:15:28,448
Okay.

184
00:15:28,618 --> 00:15:31,248
Liu! Liu! Tian-Chen and Kenny Liu.

185
00:15:31,274 --> 00:15:33,729
That family... that family's there, too.

186
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:35,768
You're lying.

187
00:15:36,057 --> 00:15:37,609
I don't know how you're doing this,

188
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:39,581
- but you're lying.
- No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

189
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,374
I swear to you I'm not.

190
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,335
I swear on my children's lives.

191
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,503
My family is trapped, and
Victor is trapped, too.

192
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,385
Then how did you get here?

193
00:15:49,256 --> 00:15:53,299
You want me to believe you just
happen to be the one person

194
00:15:53,325 --> 00:15:56,284
who somehow managed to escape
this terrifying place?

195
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,932
Listen, I don't
understand, but yes, yes.

196
00:15:59,378 --> 00:16:02,228
- And Victor helped me.
- No, don't...

197
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,440
Please.

198
00:16:05,219 --> 00:16:06,814
Victor is a good man.

199
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:10,760
He's nice and sweet,
and my son loves him.

200
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,784
And my daughter... He
saved my daughter's life.

201
00:16:19,503 --> 00:16:23,339
I thought that if I saved the
children locked in the tower, then...

202
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:27,125
somehow, I could save her from
whatever's happening to her...

203
00:16:27,197 --> 00:16:28,822
What did you say?

204
00:16:29,762 --> 00:16:33,362
Well, when I was in town, I
started seeing children,

205
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,070
or at least imagining I was.

206
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:38,190
And they were really frightening.

207
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,339
Victor said that they were
children locked in the tower,

208
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:44,813
that if I saved them,
then maybe I could...

209
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:47,498
I could somehow help my daughter
from what she's going through,

210
00:16:47,524 --> 00:16:49,416
and I don't know if I'm doing it...

211
00:16:49,526 --> 00:16:51,055
- Camden PD!
- Please.

212
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:52,831
Don't let them in. Please.

213
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:55,490
Please.

214
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,620
I'm not lying. I'm not lying.

215
00:17:06,788 --> 00:17:09,212
Henry! Henry, you in there?

216
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:11,114
Hey, man.

217
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,156
I screwed up, man. I
thought I had an intruder

218
00:17:14,223 --> 00:17:17,344
and turned out to be just
a dog off the leash.

219
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,564
The owner came back to...

220
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:23,601
Look, I owe you a dozen, okay?
I'm sorry.

221
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:26,562
All right, Henry. Take care of yourself.

222
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:29,960
Yeah, you, too. Yeah, I'm sorry. Thanks.

223
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:41,540
I, bought that almost 40 years ago...

224
00:17:43,173 --> 00:17:46,666
a few years after my family disappeared.

225
00:17:46,737 --> 00:17:50,741
I never once had the courage
to even load it, much less...

226
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,258
I'm gonna make you something to eat.

227
00:18:00,111 --> 00:18:01,513
It was an ambush.

228
00:18:01,893 --> 00:18:03,974
They knew we'd go after the animals.

229
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,993
Goddamn things opened the pen

230
00:18:06,048 --> 00:18:09,527
and just waited for us
to walk right to them.

231
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,505
How many did you save?

232
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,403
What's... What?

233
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,596
Animals.

234
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,474
How many did you save?

235
00:18:20,406 --> 00:18:21,654
Was it worth it?

236
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,834
Risking everyone's lives, for what?

237
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,921
An extra goat? A cow?

238
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:30,058
How much better off are we
today than we were yesterday?

239
00:18:30,084 --> 00:18:31,165
Wait, wait.

240
00:18:31,191 --> 00:18:33,349
Are you saying that I had a choice?

241
00:18:33,435 --> 00:18:36,511
- Those animals are all we have!
- No, Boyd!

242
00:18:36,537 --> 00:18:39,576
We are all we have!

243
00:18:39,602 --> 00:18:42,815
Us! These people! This family!

244
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:46,019
That is all we've got, and
now we've got one less!

245
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:48,216
So, what was I supposed to do?!

246
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,388
Just stand there, watching
our only resource

247
00:18:50,414 --> 00:18:52,148
go wandering off into the woods?

248
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:54,341
- We would have starved!
- We would have found another way!

249
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:57,412
Yesterday you were ready to
crawl into a fucking hole

250
00:18:57,438 --> 00:18:59,620
because the crops had spoiled!

251
00:18:59,646 --> 00:19:01,430
And now you're standing
there, telling me

252
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:02,933
that we would have found another way?!

253
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:05,232
That I shoulda just... I shoulda...

254
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:07,746
That I should just... get
the fuck outta here!

255
00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:10,536
- What the fuck am I...
- No, okay, No, you're right.

256
00:19:10,562 --> 00:19:13,552
You're right. You did
what you had to do.

257
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,755
You did the only thing you could do.

258
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,107
And you lost...

259
00:19:23,013 --> 00:19:25,341
because the game here

260
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,130
is fucking rigged.

261
00:19:30,578 --> 00:19:34,314
And no matter what hand
you play, you lose.

262
00:19:34,426 --> 00:19:36,990
- Donna. Donna.
- No, no, no.

263
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,959
I'm not angry at you, Boyd. I'm not.

264
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:43,966
I'm angry at me.

265
00:19:44,302 --> 00:19:46,005
Angry at me

266
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:50,279
because you told us that,
someday, we'd go home...

267
00:19:51,037 --> 00:19:54,365
and I was stupid enough to believe it.

268
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:57,365
- I'm...
- Get off!

269
00:20:01,397 --> 00:20:04,654
We gotta dress that cow
before the meat spoils.

270
00:20:08,653 --> 00:20:11,685
Hey. You been in there for a while.
You okay?

271
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,435
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You know, I was thinking,

272
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:16,841
maybe we should go see Kristi,
just as a precaution.

273
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,323
Look, that's not necessary.

274
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,949
It's just morning sickness.

275
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,787
Can you at least open the door?

276
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:28,165
Give me a second!

277
00:20:29,068 --> 00:20:31,205
You know, why don't I go see if Kristi

278
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,326
can just come up here, and
that way, you can just stay?

279
00:20:34,352 --> 00:20:36,287
Look, I said I'm fine!

280
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,162
I don't need everybody...

281
00:20:38,188 --> 00:20:40,441
It doesn't feel right.

282
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,933
You're not sleeping.
You're barely eating.

283
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:52,164
Fatima?

284
00:20:57,884 --> 00:21:00,050
Fatima? Hey, look, come on.
What's going on?

285
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:14,675
Fatima, you're scaring me. Come on.
Can you please open the door?

286
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:23,952
I think you're right. Maybe
we should go see Kristi.

287
00:21:28,018 --> 00:21:29,185
Kristi?

288
00:21:29,844 --> 00:21:31,179
You here?

289
00:21:32,267 --> 00:21:33,506
Wait here.

290
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:36,366
- Hello!
- Coming!

291
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,733
- Hey.
- Is Kristi here?

292
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,736
She's... She's down in town.

293
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,598
She's taking the news about
Tian-Chen pretty hard.

294
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,074
Listen, this can totally wait.

295
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,679
- The poor woman...
- No, it really can't.

296
00:21:49,705 --> 00:21:51,866
Come on in. I'll take a look at you.

297
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:56,819
You know what? Maybe we
should wait for Kristi.

298
00:21:57,889 --> 00:22:00,405
Kristi's dealing with a lot right now.

299
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,069
Yeah, but...

300
00:22:03,382 --> 00:22:05,383
Look, no offense. You're not a doctor.

301
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:07,710
I am, however, a pediatric nurse.

302
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:11,749
So, as far as pregnancy goes,
I've pretty much seen everything.

303
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,405
Come on. Come.

304
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:21,764
Kinda cold out for a swim.

305
00:22:25,314 --> 00:22:26,641
What are you doing out here?

306
00:22:27,205 --> 00:22:28,861
I just realized that...

307
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,289
I can't even remember
whose truck this was.

308
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,166
That's how many people we...

309
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:38,611
Danny.

310
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,879
And his... his girlfriend Shay.

311
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,047
Right.

312
00:22:44,392 --> 00:22:46,268
Danny and Shay.

313
00:22:47,598 --> 00:22:49,455
They were good kids, yeah.

314
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,697
What happened last night...

315
00:22:57,742 --> 00:22:59,343
it wasn't your fault.

316
00:22:59,635 --> 00:23:01,830
You know, with all due respect, Kristi,

317
00:23:02,588 --> 00:23:04,484
I'm not here for pep talks.

318
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:06,885
All due respect, Boyd, I
don't really give a shit.

319
00:23:07,877 --> 00:23:09,864
Look, after what happened with Sara,

320
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,736
when she tried to hurt Ethan...

321
00:23:12,373 --> 00:23:14,433
you sat with me in that diner

322
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:16,492
and you told me it wasn't my fault,

323
00:23:16,518 --> 00:23:18,539
that it was this place,

324
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,463
that I had saved a lot of lives,

325
00:23:20,488 --> 00:23:23,838
and that I was gonna save a hell of a lot
more by the time this all was finished.

326
00:23:23,864 --> 00:23:27,541
So, was that just a bunch of
bullshit to make me feel better,

327
00:23:27,897 --> 00:23:29,269
or did you mean it?

328
00:23:35,211 --> 00:23:37,638
This isn't your fault. Okay?

329
00:23:41,584 --> 00:23:43,662
Now, come on. Let's go
get you cleaned up.

330
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:44,789
Guys!

331
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:48,019
We found food!

332
00:23:48,045 --> 00:23:50,402
Look! Look at this!

333
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:53,285
There's a... there's a lake,
and it's got everything.

334
00:23:53,311 --> 00:23:54,847
It's got vegetables...

335
00:23:54,873 --> 00:23:56,490
They found food!

336
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,896
All right.

337
00:24:01,537 --> 00:24:03,668
There's, there's potatoes.

338
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:06,733
There might even be fish in the water.

339
00:24:08,788 --> 00:24:10,154
What's going on?

340
00:24:17,744 --> 00:24:19,158
Where are my kids?

341
00:24:19,347 --> 00:24:20,705
They're fine.

342
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:22,286
They're okay.

343
00:24:23,306 --> 00:24:24,825
Whose blood is that?

344
00:24:25,365 --> 00:24:26,517
Kenny...

345
00:24:29,382 --> 00:24:30,556
Where's...

346
00:24:32,845 --> 00:24:34,103
Wait. Where's...

347
00:24:34,822 --> 00:24:36,033
Where's my mom?

348
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,064
Kenny, maybe we should go inside.

349
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:40,000
Kenny.

350
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,468
Mom?

351
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,064
Ma!

352
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,509
Mom!

353
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:57,163
- Hey, Kenny...
- Stop! No, no, no, no, no.

354
00:25:00,828 --> 00:25:02,509
- Hey, bud. Ken.
- No, stop!

355
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,235
- Bud, I'm...
- No.

356
00:25:04,688 --> 00:25:05,946
- so s...
- Stop, stop.

357
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:08,110
- Listen, I'm so...
- No! No, no! Stop! Just...

358
00:25:08,136 --> 00:25:09,681
- Stop.
- Okay.

359
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,837
Okay?

360
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,157
Okay. Yeah.

361
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,196
- I got it.
- Okay.

362
00:25:43,621 --> 00:25:45,610
I'm so sorry. I'm so...

363
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,047
I'm so sorry.

364
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:54,674
Kenny, hey.

365
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,548
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
I'm okay.

366
00:25:57,574 --> 00:25:59,223
I'm okay. I'm okay.

367
00:26:07,827 --> 00:26:09,079
I'm okay.

368
00:26:11,293 --> 00:26:12,294
I'm okay.

369
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:14,781
I'm okay.

370
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:19,755
Where is she?

371
00:26:21,185 --> 00:26:22,537
In the church.

372
00:26:32,264 --> 00:26:33,553
I just...

373
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:39,554
I just... I need to sit
here for a minute.

374
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:42,679
- 'Kay?
- Yeah. Okay.

375
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:51,337
When was the last time you ate?

376
00:26:53,219 --> 00:26:55,522
Three... four days?

377
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:57,344
She can't keep anything down.

378
00:26:57,571 --> 00:27:01,665
I've tried to. It's just even
the smell of food, it's just...

379
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,047
Deep breath.

380
00:27:08,555 --> 00:27:10,873
- Look, are you sure we shouldn't
just get Kristi? - Ellis, just...

381
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:13,709
How've you been doing since, you know...

382
00:27:13,735 --> 00:27:15,110
Since what?

383
00:27:16,174 --> 00:27:18,415
Since I went through withdrawal,

384
00:27:18,766 --> 00:27:22,118
or since this place... mind-raped me?

385
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,350
Look, I know this is scary,

386
00:27:29,376 --> 00:27:31,048
and if it's any consolation,

387
00:27:31,074 --> 00:27:33,384
you're doing exactly what
you're supposed to be doing.

388
00:27:33,428 --> 00:27:36,865
In the tradition of first-time
fathers everywhere,

389
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,799
you're scared out of your mind,

390
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,977
and you're asking every
question you possibly can.

391
00:27:42,488 --> 00:27:45,764
As for you, you're
severely malnourished.

392
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,892
It's a wonder only one tooth fell out.

393
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:50,936
You also may have something
called hyperemesis gravidarum.

394
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,326
What is that? Is that bad?

395
00:27:53,352 --> 00:27:55,941
It's essentially really
bad morning sickness.

396
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,110
We really just need to
get you eating again.

397
00:27:58,165 --> 00:27:59,165
Okay.

398
00:27:59,298 --> 00:28:02,040
You tell that to the
world's pickiest eater.

399
00:28:02,774 --> 00:28:05,626
I'm gonna see if maybe we have something
that can settle your stomach.

400
00:28:05,652 --> 00:28:08,068
But as far as the baby?

401
00:28:08,094 --> 00:28:10,631
- Everything's okay?
- As far as I can tell,

402
00:28:10,657 --> 00:28:12,188
everything's fine.

403
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:13,704
I'll be right back.

404
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:22,399
You see? I told you.

405
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:26,055
- Everything is okay.
- Was that you?

406
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,990
- Yeah.
- That was you?

407
00:28:28,016 --> 00:28:29,850
Yeah, yeah, it was totally me, you know,

408
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:33,673
calm, cool, collected.

409
00:28:33,699 --> 00:28:35,923
Yeah. Might have missed that.

410
00:28:39,338 --> 00:28:40,930
You hear that in there?

411
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,899
Everything's gonna be okay.

412
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:53,485
Whenever things got
really bad here, she'd...

413
00:28:55,622 --> 00:28:57,582
she used to always say...

414
00:29:00,402 --> 00:29:02,968
"No matter how bad it gets,

415
00:29:03,818 --> 00:29:05,876
we'll never have this day again."

416
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,087
She'd always repeat it

417
00:29:11,113 --> 00:29:13,465
to make sure I got the message.

418
00:29:30,476 --> 00:29:31,684
Did she...

419
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:35,475
Did she suffer?

420
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,621
- Kenny, I...
- No, I...

421
00:29:38,647 --> 00:29:40,873
It's okay. You don't have to...

422
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,735
Have you seen her?

423
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,266
Have you seen what they did to her?

424
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,931
Not yet, no.

425
00:29:55,703 --> 00:29:57,915
Whenever I think about my dad...

426
00:30:01,168 --> 00:30:02,328
I can't...

427
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:06,368
All I can see is him lying
there in that basement.

428
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:11,697
I can't think of him and
not see him like that.

429
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:14,759
I don't want it to be like that for her.

430
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,561
Can you do me a favor?

431
00:30:21,062 --> 00:30:24,181
Yeah, of course.

432
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:26,691
Can you...

433
00:30:29,197 --> 00:30:30,429
Can you make her...

434
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:33,681
Can you make her look like her?

435
00:30:34,194 --> 00:30:36,213
Can you make sure she looks nice?

436
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,962
She would be really upset, if she...

437
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:43,547
if she didn't look like her.

438
00:30:45,392 --> 00:30:48,280
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

439
00:30:50,578 --> 00:30:51,782
Thank you.

440
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:55,603
Thank you.

441
00:31:01,013 --> 00:31:02,962
You... You need anything at all,

442
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:05,700
anything, you get someone
to come get me, okay?

443
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,130
Yeah. Yeah.

444
00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:10,833
Yeah.

445
00:31:25,353 --> 00:31:29,502
? Celebrate good times! Come on! ?

446
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:31,909
? Let's celebrate ?

447
00:31:33,232 --> 00:31:36,353
- ? Celebrate good times ?
- Stop it.

448
00:31:36,393 --> 00:31:37,838
- ? come on! ?
- Stop.

449
00:31:38,247 --> 00:31:40,057
? Let's celebrate ?

450
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,617
? There's a party going on right here ?

451
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,775
? A celebration to last... ?

452
00:31:45,801 --> 00:31:47,390
- Stop!
- ? Throughout the year ?

453
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:50,393
Fucking stop! Shut the fuck up!

454
00:31:51,352 --> 00:31:53,329
Stop! Fucking stop!

455
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,885
? We gonna celebrate
your party with you ?

456
00:31:55,911 --> 00:31:58,994
? Come on now. Celebra... ?

457
00:32:17,724 --> 00:32:19,024
You're back.

458
00:32:19,891 --> 00:32:21,032
Yeah.

459
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,407
Tian-Chen is dead.

460
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:30,808
I know.

461
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,342
Ethan's upstairs.

462
00:32:40,698 --> 00:32:42,104
- Julie...
- No.

463
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,563
Don't. Just please don't.

464
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:47,652
Julie, whatever you're
feeling right now,

465
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,620
it's okay.

466
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:52,542
No, it's not.

467
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:54,597
What the fuck is wrong with you?

468
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,917
Ethan almost died, too.

469
00:32:58,637 --> 00:32:59,863
Did you know that?

470
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:02,933
You should have been here, Dad. I...

471
00:33:03,402 --> 00:33:06,048
I can't. I can't be like before.

472
00:33:06,074 --> 00:33:08,441
Hey, hold on. What are
you talking about?

473
00:33:08,467 --> 00:33:11,278
I can't be the fill-in parent
while you lose your shit.

474
00:33:11,304 --> 00:33:13,316
I was looking for your mother.

475
00:33:13,803 --> 00:33:16,140
Mom is gone! Okay? She's gone!

476
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:17,762
She went through a tree,
and now she's gone!

477
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,167
Don't know that.

478
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,277
Dad...

479
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:26,855
people can't survive more than a few
hours at night without a talisman.

480
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:28,925
She's been gone four days.

481
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:33,120
I know you feel bad that you
didn't stop her, but I can't...

482
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:40,813
When Thomas died, you
and Mom fell apart,

483
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:42,730
and there was no one there for Ethan.

484
00:33:43,404 --> 00:33:44,870
I was 15.

485
00:33:46,744 --> 00:33:48,160
I can't do it again.

486
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,019
I can't. Not this time.

487
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:57,042
I need you to get your
shit together. Okay?

488
00:33:57,534 --> 00:33:58,605
Okay.

489
00:34:16,136 --> 00:34:19,029
I don't get a lot of visitors.

490
00:34:19,322 --> 00:34:22,092
At least now I know you
won't pass out on me.

491
00:34:25,485 --> 00:34:30,122
Back before she disappeared,
my wife, Miranda,

492
00:34:30,148 --> 00:34:31,904
started hearing voices.

493
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:37,232
She said they were children,
calling out to her,

494
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:40,077
that they were...

495
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:44,037
locked in a tower somewhere,

496
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:46,066
you know, crying out to be saved.

497
00:34:46,092 --> 00:34:47,943
She was terrified of them.

498
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:51,753
The only person I ever repeated that to

499
00:34:51,779 --> 00:34:54,764
was the investigating detective,

500
00:34:55,759 --> 00:34:58,889
and he died 20 years ago.

501
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:03,242
When you're done, I-I
wanna show you something.

502
00:35:04,026 --> 00:35:05,107
Yeah.

503
00:35:08,313 --> 00:35:11,232
I want you to look at this room.

504
00:35:20,277 --> 00:35:22,683
This is where my children slept.

505
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:24,824
My little boy.

506
00:35:25,566 --> 00:35:27,011
My little girl.

507
00:35:29,067 --> 00:35:31,278
They were the lights of my life.

508
00:35:33,371 --> 00:35:35,300
And when they disappeared...

509
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,472
it ripped my life to pieces.

510
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:44,261
I didn't care about the accusations.

511
00:35:44,287 --> 00:35:47,222
I didn't care that everyone
thought that I did it.

512
00:35:50,074 --> 00:35:52,261
All I could think, all I could...

513
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:53,918
remember,

514
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:55,863
even now,

515
00:35:56,656 --> 00:36:00,355
is that the last words I said to them,

516
00:36:01,644 --> 00:36:04,199
"Clean your room or no TV."

517
00:36:05,855 --> 00:36:07,566
And then, I went to work.

518
00:36:08,627 --> 00:36:10,292
When I came home...

519
00:36:11,521 --> 00:36:12,886
they were gone.

520
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,113
Why are you showing me this?

521
00:36:20,793 --> 00:36:23,490
I don't know how you know

522
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,441
about those children my wife heard.

523
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:30,183
I don't know how you got a hold
of my son's lunchbox or...

524
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:34,918
or how you could have possibly
faked those articles online.

525
00:36:35,597 --> 00:36:38,098
The only possible explanation

526
00:36:38,124 --> 00:36:40,126
I can come up with...

527
00:36:41,413 --> 00:36:43,543
is that you're actually...

528
00:36:45,035 --> 00:36:46,488
telling the truth,

529
00:36:46,977 --> 00:36:49,065
and that means my son is alive.

530
00:36:51,726 --> 00:36:52,972
And that...

531
00:36:56,683 --> 00:37:00,394
That means something I-I don't...
I don't even have the words to...

532
00:37:01,424 --> 00:37:02,821
express.

533
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:05,296
So, if you...

534
00:37:06,075 --> 00:37:07,820
if this isn't real...

535
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:11,250
you tell me right now.

536
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:15,208
If this is all just some
cruel, elaborate...

537
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,125
No, no, no, no, no. I
swear to you, it's not.

538
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,969
I believe that the reason
I was sent here...

539
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,672
was to find you.

540
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:26,305
No.

541
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:31,445
I think you're here for
what's in the basement.

542
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:49,133
I didn't want her to be alone.

543
00:37:52,872 --> 00:37:54,360
She made me tea.

544
00:38:21,402 --> 00:38:23,629
I'll give you some time.

545
00:38:29,211 --> 00:38:30,378
Wait.

546
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:34,538
I have to...

547
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:37,229
fix her before Kenny sees her,

548
00:38:38,258 --> 00:38:39,830
and I don't know how to do that.

549
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,540
I'm...

550
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:45,392
I'm not a mortician.

551
00:38:46,431 --> 00:38:49,666
- I don't...
- Hey. Let me help you.

552
00:38:53,493 --> 00:38:56,541
I used to play dress-up a lot as a kid.

553
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,276
We can do this. Right?

554
00:39:12,382 --> 00:39:13,730
There we go.

555
00:39:14,292 --> 00:39:16,386
All right, let's get you inside...

556
00:39:16,516 --> 00:39:17,980
get you fed.

557
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,339
See if Marielle's magic
elixir does the trick, okay?

558
00:39:21,574 --> 00:39:23,706
Why don't you go see your dad?

559
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:26,590
All I gotta do is get in bed,

560
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:28,574
and he's having a really hard day.

561
00:39:29,627 --> 00:39:30,716
Are you sure?

562
00:39:30,929 --> 00:39:33,824
Yeah. Go. Go. I love you.

563
00:39:35,185 --> 00:39:36,589
I love you, too.

564
00:39:40,674 --> 00:39:41,812
Here.

565
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,282
I'll be back soon.

566
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:46,425
- Give him my best, okay?
- Okay.

567
00:39:58,664 --> 00:40:00,259
None of these are any good.

568
00:40:00,897 --> 00:40:02,394
They're all gross.

569
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,985
Take those to the kitchen?

570
00:40:07,077 --> 00:40:08,303
Are those the crops?

571
00:40:08,478 --> 00:40:10,675
Yeah. We figured we'd
try composting them,

572
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,634
see if we can't get the
soil turned around.

573
00:40:13,596 --> 00:40:16,595
- You think that'll work?
- Who the hell knows?

574
00:40:18,545 --> 00:40:19,897
Sorry about yesterday,

575
00:40:19,923 --> 00:40:21,520
the bathroom, I just...

576
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:24,642
It's okay. Everyone's on,
on edge these days, so...

577
00:40:24,668 --> 00:40:27,446
Still, no reason to be a dick. Sorry.

578
00:41:40,911 --> 00:41:42,108
Victor?

579
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:46,045
Ethan, what are you doing up here?

580
00:41:48,253 --> 00:41:50,717
- Have you seen Victor?
- I haven't, no.

581
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:52,951
He's not in his room.

582
00:41:53,749 --> 00:41:55,834
He was pretty upset.

583
00:41:59,415 --> 00:42:01,763
Is that the cow that
died from last night?

584
00:42:02,423 --> 00:42:03,513
Yeah.

585
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:09,967
I've never seen what things
look like on the inside before.

586
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,671
Is that what Tian-Chen looked like...

587
00:42:13,283 --> 00:42:15,037
after what they did to her?

588
00:42:15,642 --> 00:42:17,352
No, sweetie.

589
00:42:18,907 --> 00:42:21,068
Everything's covered in snow,

590
00:42:21,794 --> 00:42:24,005
and it looks so different outside.

591
00:42:25,107 --> 00:42:26,584
I think she'd like that.

592
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,984
Hey, how about you and me...

593
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,482
I'm gonna go home.

594
00:42:37,693 --> 00:42:38,920
Ethan?

595
00:42:41,464 --> 00:42:42,698
She loved you.

596
00:42:43,604 --> 00:42:44,701
Tian-Chen.

597
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:47,418
She loved you very much.

598
00:42:48,017 --> 00:42:49,043
I know.

599
00:43:28,955 --> 00:43:30,485
Excuse me....

600
00:43:36,316 --> 00:43:38,437
When I worked at the diner,

601
00:43:39,226 --> 00:43:40,484
one of the...

602
00:43:46,121 --> 00:43:49,551
We used to try on dresses sometimes,

603
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:51,996
when things were slow.

604
00:43:53,453 --> 00:43:55,504
We'd go to the storage and...

605
00:43:58,021 --> 00:44:00,011
Well, it was silly.

606
00:44:02,398 --> 00:44:04,926
But this was the one she always...

607
00:44:09,912 --> 00:44:11,730
This one was her favorite.

608
00:44:14,855 --> 00:44:17,213
She said she'd wear it the
day we all went home.

609
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,011
I just thought...

610
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,051
Thank you, Sara.

611
00:44:23,601 --> 00:44:24,715
Thank you.

612
00:45:03,162 --> 00:45:06,157
That's a heavy pour, even
on a day like today.

613
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:08,633
What I'm about to do...

614
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:10,856
I'm gonna do.

615
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,394
And that's it. I don't wanna talk.
I don't wanna listen.

616
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,735
Kenny, what are the bottles for?

617
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,563
I'm going into the tunnels.

618
00:45:21,902 --> 00:45:23,790
I'm gonna find those things...

619
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:29,430
and I'm gonna burn every
last fucking one of them.

620
00:45:33,571 --> 00:45:36,000
- You think that'll work?
- We burned the last one.

621
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:38,337
- The last one was already dead.
- I don't care.

622
00:45:39,584 --> 00:45:40,923
I don't care.

623
00:45:42,183 --> 00:45:44,110
I'm gonna make those
fucking things hurt.

624
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:51,813
- Okay.
- Okay what?

625
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:53,665
Okay. Let's do it.

626
00:45:57,791 --> 00:45:59,000
Let's go.

627
00:46:08,526 --> 00:46:10,399
Victor and Tabitha said they're,

628
00:46:10,425 --> 00:46:11,693
everywhere down there.

629
00:46:11,886 --> 00:46:13,823
Yet Jade went down there,

630
00:46:13,894 --> 00:46:16,416
clearly saw some disturbing shit.

631
00:46:16,581 --> 00:46:18,159
What he didn't see...

632
00:46:19,394 --> 00:46:22,130
creatures, not a single one.

633
00:46:22,425 --> 00:46:24,050
Do you still think they're down there?

634
00:46:24,635 --> 00:46:26,026
I don't know.

635
00:46:26,766 --> 00:46:28,628
Maybe they went somewhere else after

636
00:46:29,506 --> 00:46:33,167
Tabitha and Victor found them
or maybe they went deeper in.

637
00:46:36,604 --> 00:46:38,183
This is one thing I do know.

638
00:46:39,581 --> 00:46:41,206
This is how they want us...

639
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:46,636
angry, stumbling around in the dark.

640
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,056
I also know this.

641
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:53,433
Hey, if we find them,

642
00:46:54,354 --> 00:46:56,769
there's a good chance
we are not coming back.

643
00:46:57,472 --> 00:46:59,464
But if this is what you want to do...

644
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:03,440
I will go with you, side by side,

645
00:47:04,056 --> 00:47:07,558
and we will take out as many of
those motherfuckers as we can.

646
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:13,181
I can't stop thinking about...

647
00:47:13,682 --> 00:47:14,916
how...

648
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:20,522
scared she must have been,

649
00:47:20,548 --> 00:47:22,644
how alone she must have felt.

650
00:47:23,246 --> 00:47:24,455
Hey.

651
00:47:26,883 --> 00:47:28,292
She wasn't alone.

652
00:47:30,557 --> 00:47:31,651
What?

653
00:47:34,724 --> 00:47:36,370
They made me watch.

654
00:47:37,227 --> 00:47:39,120
I couldn't help her. I couldn't...

655
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:41,136
They made me watch.

656
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,394
They made me watch.

657
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:48,245
I couldn't help her. I couldn't...

658
00:47:48,667 --> 00:47:50,839
But... Hey.

659
00:47:51,136 --> 00:47:52,852
She was strong, Kenny.

660
00:47:52,878 --> 00:47:54,097
- She was strong.
- No, no.

661
00:47:54,122 --> 00:47:56,975
Listen, listen to me. She was brave.

662
00:47:57,292 --> 00:48:01,456
She looked at me, and she did
not take her eyes off me.

663
00:48:01,735 --> 00:48:02,961
And before...

664
00:48:03,673 --> 00:48:05,612
before she died, she said...

665
00:48:11,902 --> 00:48:14,940
You know, I don't even know
if I'm saying this right.

666
00:48:22,749 --> 00:48:26,144
"Take care of him"...
that's what it means.

667
00:48:27,263 --> 00:48:28,870
"Take care of him."

668
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:34,034
"He'll be alone now."

669
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:41,136
Come here. Come here, man. Come here.

670
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:43,065
It's okay.

671
00:48:44,481 --> 00:48:45,862
I got you, brother.

672
00:48:48,245 --> 00:48:50,144
Hey, let's go back, okay?

673
00:48:51,107 --> 00:48:52,472
Let's go back.

674
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:12,534
Think her hair's okay?

675
00:49:15,589 --> 00:49:17,464
Yeah, I think her hair is great.

676
00:49:18,611 --> 00:49:22,151
What about the makeup? Do you think...
do you think her makeup's okay?

677
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:25,938
Honestly, I think if you try and
put any more makeup on her,

678
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,839
Tian-Chen might sit up and slap
the lipstick out of your hand.

679
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:32,190
I just... I just... I just
want it to be right for Kenny.

680
00:49:33,746 --> 00:49:34,885
It's right.

681
00:49:36,012 --> 00:49:37,065
Okay?

682
00:49:39,012 --> 00:49:40,111
It's right.

683
00:49:47,547 --> 00:49:49,545
You'll come with us when we go.

684
00:51:15,355 --> 00:51:17,043
I just wanted to say thank you

685
00:51:17,675 --> 00:51:19,301
for what you did last night.

686
00:51:19,475 --> 00:51:20,574
You're welcome.

687
00:51:21,204 --> 00:51:24,526
Something happened to me a few days ago.

688
00:51:24,552 --> 00:51:27,863
- I was...
- I heard. You okay?

689
00:51:29,521 --> 00:51:32,270
No. No, not really.

690
00:51:35,746 --> 00:51:37,988
I think this place has
gotten in my head now,

691
00:51:38,934 --> 00:51:40,936
and I'm scared of what that might mean.

692
00:51:42,334 --> 00:51:44,159
I don't want to hurt anybody.

693
00:51:44,412 --> 00:51:45,856
- I don't...
- It's okay.

694
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,192
You can say it.

695
00:51:51,054 --> 00:51:52,890
I don't wanna end up like you.

696
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:55,250
I wouldn't either.

697
00:52:01,314 --> 00:52:02,915
If you ever want to talk...

698
00:52:03,478 --> 00:52:04,687
Thanks.

699
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:15,016
Well, believe it or not, it
all started on my birthday.

700
00:52:15,242 --> 00:52:19,219
See, me and Miranda were
hippies back in the day,

701
00:52:19,245 --> 00:52:21,363
but we gave up all the drugs,

702
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:24,359
all the drinking when she
got pregnant with Victor.

703
00:52:24,504 --> 00:52:29,692
Then, one day, years later,
it was my 35th birthday,

704
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:31,749
Miranda gets it in her head

705
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:34,836
that we're gonna take a
stroll down memory lane.

706
00:52:34,861 --> 00:52:37,672
She gets us two hits of acid.

707
00:52:37,891 --> 00:52:41,592
We take the kids to her
parents' house for the night,

708
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:45,137
and we take one last trip
for old times' sake.

709
00:52:45,406 --> 00:52:48,307
That's when the voices started,

710
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,726
when she started seeing things.

711
00:52:50,883 --> 00:52:54,313
She painted everything she saw.

712
00:53:01,321 --> 00:53:02,710
Oh, my God.

713
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:09,335
I've seen that, too.

714
00:53:09,588 --> 00:53:13,290
She said it was like she'd been chosen.

715
00:53:14,312 --> 00:53:17,429
She said it was a place

716
00:53:17,685 --> 00:53:19,484
that was everywhere,

717
00:53:19,648 --> 00:53:21,997
but you couldn't find it if you tried.

718
00:53:22,023 --> 00:53:23,280
Oh, my God.

719
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,844
Oh, my God.

720
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:28,648
Somewhere you could stumble
into from anywhere,

721
00:53:29,186 --> 00:53:31,499
but never find a way to leave.

722
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:37,226
She said there were people there...

723
00:53:41,804 --> 00:53:44,234
people who were lost...

724
00:53:45,135 --> 00:53:46,554
and afraid...

725
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:54,074
who found themselves
living inside a nightmare

726
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,477
that they couldn't escape...

727
00:53:59,859 --> 00:54:04,072
fighting a battle they
knew they couldn't win.

728
00:54:07,309 --> 00:54:10,640
She said they were holding on to hope.

729
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:16,648
And when that hope was gone...

730
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,054
they held on to each other.

731
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:29,597
It all sounded like riddles,

732
00:54:29,786 --> 00:54:31,028
gibberish.

733
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:34,939
She said that, of all the people

734
00:54:34,965 --> 00:54:38,418
who would find their way to this place,

735
00:54:38,794 --> 00:54:44,675
she was the one who had been
chosen to free the children.

736
00:54:46,586 --> 00:54:49,418
But she wasn't the first.

737
00:54:49,527 --> 00:54:52,681
Others were chosen before her.

738
00:54:52,707 --> 00:54:56,308
She could see each and every one.

739
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:59,285
And all of them had failed.

740
00:54:59,632 --> 00:55:03,569
None of them had ever
set the children free.

741
00:55:03,595 --> 00:55:07,511
And none of them had ever gone home.

742
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:11,790
So, if you've seen the children,

743
00:55:11,816 --> 00:55:14,668
if they've called to
you, then I guess...

744
00:55:14,694 --> 00:55:16,886
you've been chosen now, too.

745
00:55:18,456 --> 00:55:23,058
- So, how did you get out?
- Oh, my God.

746
00:55:52,603 --> 00:55:54,043
How you holding up?

747
00:55:57,536 --> 00:55:58,683
Dad.

748
00:55:58,947 --> 00:56:00,160
Not good.

749
00:56:01,342 --> 00:56:02,472
Not good.

750
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:07,777
Look, I know you...

751
00:56:09,238 --> 00:56:11,488
carry a lot of weight from this place,

752
00:56:12,574 --> 00:56:13,754
and...

753
00:56:14,723 --> 00:56:18,058
I know it feels like everything
that happens here...

754
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:19,643
We can't keep doing this.

755
00:56:19,894 --> 00:56:23,207
We can't just keep sitting around,
waiting to see what...

756
00:56:23,793 --> 00:56:26,402
- We need more information.
- Yeah.

757
00:56:27,714 --> 00:56:29,948
- Yeah. - I'm gonna need your help
with something tomorrow.

758
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:31,565
Okay?

759
00:56:32,957 --> 00:56:35,076
Yeah, all right. But with what?

760
00:56:35,858 --> 00:56:38,340
We're gonna catch one of
these fucking things.

761
00:56:41,779 --> 00:56:43,381
Are we still gonna live here?

762
00:56:43,929 --> 00:56:45,816
Even though Tian-Chen is gone?

763
00:56:46,253 --> 00:56:47,551
I don't know.

764
00:56:48,334 --> 00:56:50,519
I have to take that one step at a time.

765
00:56:52,285 --> 00:56:53,714
Are you not coming inside?

766
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,176
No, I'm gonna go check on the
animals, and make sure they're fed.

767
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,808
It's almost dark.

768
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:01,754
- Won't be long.
- I'm gonna go, too.

769
00:57:03,074 --> 00:57:05,554
Well, just be careful.

770
00:57:05,871 --> 00:57:07,019
Yeah, okay.

771
00:57:07,706 --> 00:57:09,082
I love you guys.

772
00:58:07,771 --> 00:58:08,928
Hello?

773
00:58:09,227 --> 00:58:10,419
Dad?

774
00:58:10,842 --> 00:58:12,084
It's Thomas.
