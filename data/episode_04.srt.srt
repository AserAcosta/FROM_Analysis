1
00:00:16,937 --> 00:00:18,981
Previously on From.

2
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,796
Fuck! Just get this
fucking thing off of me.

3
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,524
Pull! Pull!

4
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:26,351
- Shit. Are you good?
- My ankle.

5
00:00:26,377 --> 00:00:27,515
- It's dislocated.
- All right.

6
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,335
- Let's get her back to camp.
- Okay.

7
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:30,827
I wanna catch one of those things.

8
00:00:30,853 --> 00:00:32,304
We need to learn about them.

9
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,976
We catch one. We make it talk.

10
00:00:44,394 --> 00:00:45,916
Maybe we switch tonight.

11
00:00:45,986 --> 00:00:48,244
- I'll take the bus.
- Why?

12
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:51,471
Because I wanna watch our friends when
they come out of the woods tonight.

13
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:54,766
We need to build a fort.

14
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:57,103
Then I'm gonna tell a story.

15
00:00:57,546 --> 00:00:59,071
Are those the crops?

16
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:01,736
Yeah. We figured we'd
try composting them.

17
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,124
Whatever's going on,

18
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,276
I promise it'll pass.

19
00:01:07,302 --> 00:01:09,393
Is my baby okay?

20
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,057
Let's see what the cards have to say.

21
00:01:16,226 --> 00:01:18,872
Miranda used to call it the bottle tree.

22
00:01:18,898 --> 00:01:23,101
The original's in a
park a few towns over.

23
00:01:23,132 --> 00:01:25,085
Miranda made that for me.

24
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:26,561
This can't be real.

25
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,843
I found this in the diner.

26
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:30,164
Pull over right now!

27
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,539
- No!
- No, no!

28
00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:32,983
We're going!

29
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:38,234
Where am I?

30
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,546
There's a tree in the
middle of the road.

31
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:53,072
Unit 4-5. Unit 4-5.

32
00:01:53,098 --> 00:01:54,891
Hospital, do you copy?

33
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:56,210
Do you copy?

34
00:01:56,663 --> 00:01:59,536
Unit 4-5. Unit 4-5. Mechanical en route.

35
00:02:01,403 --> 00:02:02,956
Copy. Copy.

36
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:04,731
Just getting static.

37
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:07,092
Where is everyone?

38
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:09,484
Should be at least a little
traffic this time of day.

39
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,427
Yeah, well, we're not
gonna move it, so...

40
00:02:12,093 --> 00:02:13,552
My God.

41
00:02:16,693 --> 00:02:18,490
Unit 4-5. Do you copy?

42
00:02:18,516 --> 00:02:20,256
- Oh, my God.
- We're 30, 35 out.

43
00:02:20,282 --> 00:02:22,716
We got a tree blocking the road.

44
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:24,763
Unit 4-5. Do you copy?

45
00:02:27,418 --> 00:02:29,662
Miss, I need you to get
back in the vehicle.

46
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:33,099
No.

47
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,287
Unit 4-5. Unit 4-5. Do...

48
00:03:03,043 --> 00:03:05,519
Just take a detour! Go around it!

49
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:07,064
Ma'am, let's get back inside.

50
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,704
- It's not gonna work.
- It's okay.

51
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,588
- It's not gonna work.
- We'll take another way. It's okay.

52
00:03:10,614 --> 00:03:11,684
It's okay.

53
00:03:12,707 --> 00:03:14,408
- It's all right.
- It's not gonna work.

54
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:16,747
- It'll be okay. We'll get you back inside.
- You have to listen to me!

55
00:03:16,874 --> 00:03:17,988
Come on.

56
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:39,945
Hello?

57
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:42,416
Ethan? It's Thomas.

58
00:03:42,442 --> 00:03:44,104
Mommy's in trouble.

59
00:03:44,466 --> 00:03:46,650
She's in an ambulance.

60
00:03:46,676 --> 00:03:48,322
What ambulance?

61
00:03:48,356 --> 00:03:51,615
You'll see. She's on her way,
but you have to help her.

62
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:53,435
You can't be afraid.

63
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:56,968
Who is this?

64
00:03:56,994 --> 00:03:59,307
I told you. It's Thomas.

65
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,049
Who is this really?

66
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:02,838
Who is this?

67
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,486
Who are you talking to?

68
00:04:06,864 --> 00:04:08,782
He says he's Thomas.

69
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,661
Hi, Jim.

70
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,805
You leave my children alone.

71
00:04:23,027 --> 00:04:26,434
But they're not your children anymore.

72
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:42,191
Dad?

73
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:56,145
What did he say?

74
00:04:58,747 --> 00:05:01,268
Ethan, I need you to talk to me.
What did he say?

75
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:04,096
That Mom was alive.

76
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:06,150
She's on an ambulance.

77
00:05:06,331 --> 00:05:08,065
She needs our help.

78
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,635
www.subtitulamos.tv

79
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:16,843
What are you waiting for? Pick it up.

80
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,996
You pick it up. I'm not
touching that thing.

81
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,426
It's dead. What are you worried about?

82
00:07:21,452 --> 00:07:22,901
That bird just went kamikaze

83
00:07:22,927 --> 00:07:24,887
through a plate-glass
window to get in here.

84
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:28,379
Whatever bad juju that thing has,
I don't want any part of it.

85
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,924
And by the way,

86
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,056
I don't mean to ask the
obvious question here,

87
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:35,683
but do you think it's really smart to
do tarot readings in a place like this?

88
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:38,117
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- Hey, that's enough.

89
00:07:38,143 --> 00:07:41,754
We got plenty to worry about without
people sniping at each other.

90
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,855
Hey, you all right?

91
00:07:48,152 --> 00:07:49,362
I'm good.

92
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:51,933
You sure?

93
00:08:00,617 --> 00:08:03,707
I had no idea things were
so exciting up here.

94
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,653
Open.

95
00:08:08,482 --> 00:08:09,692
You're good.

96
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:12,826
Look, this really is not necessary.

97
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,356
Don't be silly.

98
00:08:14,684 --> 00:08:16,700
I make it a point to
examine all my patients

99
00:08:16,726 --> 00:08:19,437
after they've had encounters
with psychotic birds.

100
00:08:19,463 --> 00:08:22,059
Besides, it's helping take my mind off

101
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,244
of Kristi being out at that lake.

102
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,958
No. They'll be fine.

103
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:29,739
They've got shelter.
They've got talismans.

104
00:08:29,765 --> 00:08:32,630
- It's all you need.
- I know.

105
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:38,734
But...

106
00:08:39,827 --> 00:08:42,929
if it was Ellis, I would
be feeling the same way.

107
00:08:44,842 --> 00:08:45,922
Drink.

108
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:49,867
It's nice to just be

109
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:52,133
taking care of a pregnant
Mama bear again.

110
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,875
You look much better.

111
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:57,929
Your color's improved.

112
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,640
You've been eating a little more?

113
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,966
Yeah.

114
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:04,002
Finally found something
I could keep down.

115
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,726
Great. Get that baby nice and strong.

116
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,638
We used to play in here.

117
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:15,707
Not at night.

118
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:18,157
At nighttime, everyone had to hide.

119
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,018
There were no talismans then.

120
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:21,935
But during the daytime,

121
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,388
my sister and I would
play inside the houses.

122
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,857
We pretended that we were home again.

123
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:36,943
She always liked this one the
best, and I never knew why.

124
00:09:37,554 --> 00:09:39,427
You came here with your sister?

125
00:09:39,693 --> 00:09:42,427
My mother, too, but they died.

126
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,044
Just like Nathan,

127
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,607
except I didn't murder them.

128
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,807
Is this enough?

129
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:02,467
Yeah, that's good.

130
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:06,498
I don't understand what we're doing.

131
00:10:06,538 --> 00:10:08,597
I told you, I have to remember.

132
00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:10,013
Remember what?

133
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,803
When I was a boy, my mother

134
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,529
tried to save everyone, but she died.

135
00:10:15,678 --> 00:10:20,006
And then everyone died, and
I can't remember how...

136
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,030
or why.

137
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:24,116
And I think I need to remember soon.

138
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,126
Why?

139
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:28,427
Too many things are changing.

140
00:10:28,902 --> 00:10:30,779
It's never snowed here before.

141
00:10:35,106 --> 00:10:36,709
We have to go in the basement.

142
00:10:36,735 --> 00:10:38,612
Up here is for daytime stories.

143
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,537
The basement's for secrets.

144
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,824
Hello? Unit 4-5.

145
00:10:52,496 --> 00:10:54,392
How are we still in the goddamn woods?

146
00:10:54,418 --> 00:10:56,634
We were right outside the city
when we stopped at that tree.

147
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,902
What does the GPS say?

148
00:10:57,928 --> 00:11:00,134
Same thing it said ten minutes ago...
data unavailable.

149
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,337
We gotta be driving in circles.
The woods aren't this deep.

150
00:11:02,363 --> 00:11:05,527
- Okay, fine. I'll turn around.
- No, no, no! Please don't turn around!

151
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,605
Just keep going forward.

152
00:11:07,631 --> 00:11:09,246
- Lady, calm down.
- If you turn around,

153
00:11:09,272 --> 00:11:11,088
you'll be driving away from town!

154
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:13,527
What town? We're looking
for the highway.

155
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:15,269
I know, I know, but...

156
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,319
You have to listen to me. It's...

157
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,743
It's not safe to stop out
here once it gets dark,

158
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:23,808
but there's a town up ahead,
and people there can help us.

159
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:26,777
You just need to keep
going forward, please.

160
00:11:38,552 --> 00:11:41,315
So, you're gonna watch these things,

161
00:11:41,381 --> 00:11:43,932
get a sense of how they
move and what they do,

162
00:11:44,658 --> 00:11:46,567
and that's gonna what?

163
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:49,362
Give you some grand insight into
how you're gonna catch one?

164
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,073
Yeah.

165
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:53,081
Something like that.

166
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:55,268
Yeah. Okay.

167
00:11:55,697 --> 00:11:57,753
I'm sure nothing terrible
is gonna come of that.

168
00:11:59,674 --> 00:12:01,138
Why are you here?

169
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:03,206
What do you mean?

170
00:12:03,868 --> 00:12:05,714
I said we could switch.

171
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:09,275
You could be fast asleep by
now in the sheriff's station.

172
00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:11,533
So, why are you here?

173
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,815
That's none of your business.

174
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,019
What the fuck do you care, anyway?

175
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:24,301
'Cause if I gotta stand here
all night and listen to you,

176
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,839
I'd at least like to know why that is.

177
00:12:26,865 --> 00:12:30,425
Look, if you're gonna do something
that has even the slightest chance

178
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:31,667
of getting us the hell out of here,

179
00:12:31,693 --> 00:12:34,573
no matter how stupid or ill-advised
that thing might be...

180
00:12:36,474 --> 00:12:37,698
then I wanna help.

181
00:12:39,144 --> 00:12:41,761
So, now, all of a sudden,
you're a team player.

182
00:12:42,616 --> 00:12:44,574
If you'd seen the things I've seen,

183
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,032
then you might be, too.

184
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:51,162
What are you talking about,
seen the things you've seen?

185
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,488
What do you think I'm
talking about, Boyd?

186
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,418
Me, Julie, Marielle,

187
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,535
wherever we were.

188
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:06,385
Everybody here just talks about
how afraid they are of dying.

189
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:08,496
I don't think that's the worst thing

190
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:10,089
that can happen to you here.

191
00:13:12,577 --> 00:13:14,204
I want out.

192
00:13:26,295 --> 00:13:27,775
You should get some sleep.

193
00:13:27,994 --> 00:13:29,838
Tomorrow's gonna be a long day.

194
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,424
Sorry. Did I wake you up?

195
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,580
No. The, throbbing pain in my ankle did.

196
00:13:37,312 --> 00:13:40,658
Is there anything I can do
to help make it better?

197
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,291
No, not until, some of
the swelling goes down.

198
00:13:49,685 --> 00:13:51,119
What are you writing?

199
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,931
It's just... something for my mom.

200
00:13:57,658 --> 00:13:58,892
In Chinese culture,

201
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:02,072
we write letters to the
dead on high holidays.

202
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:04,799
It's not really a
holiday, I guess, but...

203
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:07,086
I think she'd really like that.

204
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,744
Yep.

205
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,434
I meant what I said earlier.

206
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:13,485
You're not alone here.

207
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:16,759
Things are different now. That's all.

208
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:18,095
Yeah.

209
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,936
It just feels like...

210
00:14:21,702 --> 00:14:23,193
all of a sudden...

211
00:14:24,723 --> 00:14:27,954
everything that I thought I
was fighting for is gone.

212
00:14:31,524 --> 00:14:34,194
And everything that I thought
I was going home to.

213
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:38,766
And the two people that I
would talk to about that

214
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:41,834
are you and Mom.

215
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,498
You can still talk to me.

216
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:47,825
Could you maybe talk in the morning?

217
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:51,769
Sorry.

218
00:14:54,044 --> 00:14:55,323
Fuck it.

219
00:14:56,244 --> 00:14:57,701
I'm awake.

220
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,395
Hey.

221
00:15:12,826 --> 00:15:15,006
You guys wanna hear something crazy?

222
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,460
The night everyone died,

223
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,935
I was in the root cellar.

224
00:15:23,475 --> 00:15:26,585
My mother told Eloise
and I to hide there.

225
00:15:26,918 --> 00:15:29,014
Eloise didn't listen.

226
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,012
But I did.

227
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:49,148
I stayed until morning.

228
00:15:52,392 --> 00:15:54,108
And when I came out,

229
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:57,694
there were bodies everywhere.

230
00:16:02,982 --> 00:16:05,462
That was the day that I
met the boy in white.

231
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,136
You know the boy in white?

232
00:16:10,162 --> 00:16:11,580
He's my friend.

233
00:16:11,606 --> 00:16:15,431
He was my only friend all
those years that I was alone.

234
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,241
Couldn't bury them all.

235
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:32,046
They were just lying there
in the street, and...

236
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:34,671
I couldn't bury them.

237
00:16:37,153 --> 00:16:39,116
So the boy in white

238
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:41,350
told me to...

239
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,756
gather things that
were precious to them.

240
00:16:48,743 --> 00:16:50,811
To bury those instead.

241
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,264
This stuff...

242
00:16:57,942 --> 00:17:00,319
that'll help you remember
why it happened?

243
00:17:01,176 --> 00:17:02,553
I think so.

244
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,327
Why are we in here?

245
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,319
Because it's a fort.

246
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:12,327
Why do you need me?

247
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:16,163
Because I don't want to do this alone.

248
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,648
I may have to remember
some scary things.

249
00:17:23,514 --> 00:17:25,358
And you're the scariest person here,

250
00:17:25,384 --> 00:17:27,436
so it won't scare you.

251
00:17:34,632 --> 00:17:36,342
You always this fidgety?

252
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,001
Something's wrong.

253
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,508
Those things should be all
over the place by now.

254
00:17:40,534 --> 00:17:41,618
Really?

255
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,736
These things give "creature of
habit" a whole new goddamn meaning.

256
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,018
The one in the nurse's uniform?

257
00:17:47,447 --> 00:17:49,103
I'm her first stop every night,

258
00:17:49,129 --> 00:17:50,502
every single night.

259
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,530
She just stands by the
glass, and she hums.

260
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:54,353
For about ten minutes, she just stands,

261
00:17:54,379 --> 00:17:56,970
taps on the glass with
her fucking smile.

262
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,382
And there's another one, right? Likes
to sit over there by the swing.

263
00:18:01,408 --> 00:18:04,111
- Okay.
- Just letting its legs dangle.

264
00:18:04,232 --> 00:18:06,900
There's another couple like to sit
over there by the pool, just...

265
00:18:07,293 --> 00:18:09,253
You really watch these things closely.

266
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:11,314
Yeah, well, there's no TV.

267
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:14,947
Plus, you guys get to draw the
shades at night. I got...

268
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:19,431
Look. The point is, they
got patterns, routines,

269
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:22,064
all of which should be
happening right now.

270
00:18:23,355 --> 00:18:24,837
Right now.

271
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:28,999
- Ma'am, you're not making any sense.
- I know this road.

272
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,125
There's a town up ahead. The
people there can help us

273
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,000
- find the highway again. I promise you.
- Okay.

274
00:18:33,026 --> 00:18:35,101
We just need to keep going that way.

275
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:41,747
We're here! The barn is here!

276
00:18:41,773 --> 00:18:43,680
- Stop! Stop here!
- Lady, we're fine, okay?

277
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,415
We're not gonna stop in
the middle of nowhere.

278
00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:46,601
Fuck.

279
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:49,797
Oh, shit. What the...

280
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,148
What the fuck?

281
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,851
It's an ambulance, just like he said!

282
00:19:05,488 --> 00:19:06,531
Mom!

283
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh, no, no.

284
00:19:08,026 --> 00:19:09,586
- Get in here!
- I got him.

285
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:11,593
- No! No!
- Got him.

286
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,476
- Let's get back inside.
- No! Mom!

287
00:19:13,504 --> 00:19:14,859
You need to stop. Please stop.

288
00:19:14,885 --> 00:19:17,047
Lady. I'm not gonna
tell you again, okay?

289
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,914
Shit.

290
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:23,211
- What's wrong?
- We got a body in the road.

291
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,582
What if Mom's really out there?

292
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,023
What's he talking about?

293
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:29,883
The voice on the phone said
she'd be on an ambulance.

294
00:19:31,402 --> 00:19:33,187
There's somebody lying in
the middle of the road.

295
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,297
No.

296
00:19:34,427 --> 00:19:35,927
It's not a fucking person!

297
00:19:35,953 --> 00:19:37,594
- That is not a fucking person!
- Okay!

298
00:19:37,637 --> 00:19:39,810
We're just gonna calm down, okay?

299
00:19:39,836 --> 00:19:41,347
- No, no, no!
- Go ahead. I got this.

300
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:42,864
You are not fucking listening to me.

301
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,226
Where are you going? Don't go.

302
00:19:44,252 --> 00:19:45,383
- Please don't fucking go!
- Move!

303
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:47,336
- If you fucking leave you're gonna
fucking die! - Ma'am! Ma'am.

304
00:19:47,362 --> 00:19:49,461
Okay. You need to calm down!

305
00:19:49,487 --> 00:19:51,615
You need to fucking calm down!
They're gonna die!

306
00:19:51,641 --> 00:19:53,672
They're gonna fucking die!

307
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,250
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

308
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:02,779
Ma'am, can you hear me?

309
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,052
- Okay.
- Here. Help me roll her over. Come on.

310
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,958
Watch her head.

311
00:20:09,912 --> 00:20:11,325
I'm not getting a pulse.

312
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:13,380
Hey, guys!

313
00:20:13,406 --> 00:20:15,366
Lady's really freaking out back here.

314
00:20:15,392 --> 00:20:17,341
What the...

315
00:20:25,495 --> 00:20:26,708
Oh, my God!

316
00:20:39,603 --> 00:20:40,782
Back up!

317
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:48,706
- Okay.
- Those were gunshots!

318
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,730
Which means those things
are already out there.

319
00:21:08,377 --> 00:21:09,501
Oh, my God.

320
00:21:09,752 --> 00:21:11,791
- Henry?
- What?

321
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,072
It's okay.

322
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:14,431
- What?
- We're okay.

323
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:16,908
If there's even a chance
my wife is out there...

324
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,611
You do what you want.

325
00:21:20,244 --> 00:21:22,976
Okay. Listen. You gotta stay inside.

326
00:21:23,002 --> 00:21:24,569
Whoever's on that ambulance,

327
00:21:24,595 --> 00:21:27,369
you'll be putting them in danger if
we have to worry about you, okay?

328
00:21:27,395 --> 00:21:28,658
I need you to tell me you understand.

329
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:29,947
- I understand.
- Julie?

330
00:21:29,973 --> 00:21:30,986
Yeah.

331
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,486
We are in real danger right now.

332
00:21:35,512 --> 00:21:37,520
There are things in this
town that will hurt us

333
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,580
if we don't get inside
one of the houses.

334
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:41,676
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

335
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,462
Oh, mother of God!

336
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,877
Oh, my God!

337
00:21:46,884 --> 00:21:48,908
Oh, my God! Jim! Jim!

338
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:50,429
Tabitha.

339
00:21:50,536 --> 00:21:52,580
Oh, my God! Jim! Jim!

340
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,134
Help me! Help me! Please help me, baby!

341
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,447
Please help us!

342
00:21:59,275 --> 00:22:01,541
- Are there keys?
- I don't know! I don't know where they are!

343
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:03,869
Everybody, out of the ambulance, now!

344
00:22:05,168 --> 00:22:07,759
- Jesus.
- What the fuck?

345
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,892
Handcuffs.

346
00:22:10,025 --> 00:22:12,283
- What?
- You have handcuffs. Hand me the keys.

347
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:15,599
I don't have them.

348
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:17,978
- No...
- There's a toolkit on the bus.

349
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,947
- I got it. Got it!
- No! Wait, wait!

350
00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:23,650
All right! Stay, stay, stay!

351
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,189
Runner on the hill!

352
00:22:25,215 --> 00:22:26,970
Runner on the hill!

353
00:22:38,882 --> 00:22:40,568
I think it's a cop.

354
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,164
What the fuck?

355
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:54,227
- What was that?
- Nicky's been shot!

356
00:22:54,436 --> 00:22:55,711
Excuse me.

357
00:22:56,836 --> 00:22:57,934
What happened?

358
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,570
- Did she hit her head?
- I don't know.

359
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:02,328
- Get that window boarded up.
- Here, get her onto the couch.

360
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:06,172
Let her have some air.

361
00:23:06,198 --> 00:23:08,031
- Come on.
- All right. All right.

362
00:23:11,582 --> 00:23:12,833
It's Nicky?

363
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,858
Hey, Nicky. I'm Marielle.
I'm gonna help you, okay?

364
00:23:14,884 --> 00:23:16,926
Easy, easy.

365
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:21,045
Help me roll her onto her side.
Okay. All right.

366
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:25,662
Okay. No exit wound. We need
to get this bullet out.

367
00:23:26,987 --> 00:23:28,448
Hey, open up!

368
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:29,909
I'm a police officer!

369
00:23:29,935 --> 00:23:31,493
- Hey, move.
- What are you doing? - Please!

370
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:33,913
- She's a cop. We can't just leave
her out there. - Open the door!

371
00:23:33,939 --> 00:23:36,292
- We should wait for Kristi.
- Kristi's not back until tomorrow.

372
00:23:36,318 --> 00:23:39,017
We need to do this now. Hey, I'm
gonna need a lot of things.

373
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:42,367
Tweezers, pliers, alcohol, and towels.

374
00:23:42,393 --> 00:23:43,948
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

375
00:23:45,844 --> 00:23:47,300
I know.

376
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,956
Okay.

377
00:23:53,229 --> 00:23:54,924
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

378
00:23:55,861 --> 00:23:56,917
Okay.

379
00:23:58,394 --> 00:23:59,745
Oh, God.

380
00:23:59,822 --> 00:24:02,534
- Those things were coming from
everywhere. I didn't mean to... - You not!

381
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:04,737
No. Listen. You gotta believe me.
Please, you gotta believe me.

382
00:24:04,763 --> 00:24:07,445
- It must have been a misfire!
- I said back the fuck up!

383
00:24:07,534 --> 00:24:09,769
Oh, God. This isn't real.

384
00:24:09,795 --> 00:24:12,952
This isn't real. This can't be
happening. This isn't real.

385
00:24:12,978 --> 00:24:14,897
- Is there anyone with you?
- What?

386
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,511
- Is there anyone else out there?
- Is she gonna be okay?

387
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:18,977
How did you get here?

388
00:24:19,003 --> 00:24:22,433
We were in an ambulance.
There was this tree.

389
00:24:31,343 --> 00:24:33,508
Where are the fucking keys.

390
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,657
Get the fuck back.

391
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,529
I said get the fuck back!

392
00:24:42,555 --> 00:24:45,311
Oh, sweetie, it doesn't work that way.

393
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,063
Hey, get back to the bus!

394
00:25:01,005 --> 00:25:02,102
Hey, Jim!

395
00:25:02,128 --> 00:25:03,954
Hey. Tools.

396
00:25:04,945 --> 00:25:06,864
Boyd, we got to go.

397
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,884
Get something! Get something!

398
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:13,220
I can't find the fucking keys!

399
00:25:13,687 --> 00:25:15,906
- Where the...
- Are you looking for these?

400
00:25:16,135 --> 00:25:17,673
Motherfucker!

401
00:25:18,729 --> 00:25:20,164
Take them.

402
00:25:21,258 --> 00:25:23,258
We get to keep Randall, though.

403
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,628
Get off me!

404
00:25:35,831 --> 00:25:37,842
You can't save them all.

405
00:25:46,885 --> 00:25:49,100
Boyd, let's go! We
gotta get out of here!

406
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,579
Fuck you! Fuck you!

407
00:25:55,413 --> 00:25:56,762
Motherfuckers.

408
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,232
Fuck you!

409
00:26:00,286 --> 00:26:03,702
Boyd? Boyd, don't you leave
me, you piece of shit!

410
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:06,928
Apply pressure right here.

411
00:26:07,136 --> 00:26:09,624
Okay. All right. Good.

412
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,488
- Good. Okay. Good.
- Yeah?

413
00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:17,076
- Are you sure you've got this?
- Yeah. Yeah. I got it.

414
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,460
Sit here. Hold her legs down.

415
00:26:19,486 --> 00:26:22,155
- Okay. Okay. I got it.
- Keep her still.

416
00:26:23,483 --> 00:26:25,042
- Come on.
- Okay? - Yeah.

417
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:28,663
Little sting. I know. I know. I know.

418
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:30,566
Shit. Okay. Let me see.

419
00:26:31,163 --> 00:26:32,539
Okay. Let me see.

420
00:26:32,565 --> 00:26:34,038
Bite down. Bite down.

421
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:37,285
- Hold her very still.
- Come on, Nicky.

422
00:26:37,311 --> 00:26:38,796
Here we go.

423
00:26:38,822 --> 00:26:41,645
All right. Here we go. I know. I know.

424
00:26:41,671 --> 00:26:43,100
- You got this.
- All right.

425
00:26:43,126 --> 00:26:44,741
It's okay. It's okay.

426
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:48,819
Okay. I think I got it.

427
00:26:50,656 --> 00:26:51,858
Okay.

428
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:56,866
Okay. We got it.

429
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,982
Yeah.

430
00:26:59,008 --> 00:27:00,311
Good job.

431
00:27:01,421 --> 00:27:03,077
There's a woman in the ambulance.

432
00:27:03,103 --> 00:27:04,928
There were two paramedics outside,

433
00:27:04,954 --> 00:27:07,585
and I don't know where she is, but
this is probably 20 minutes...

434
00:27:19,312 --> 00:27:20,588
It's okay.

435
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:25,561
- Oh, my God! Yes, yes, yes!
- That's it. That's it. Okay.

436
00:27:25,587 --> 00:27:27,037
- Thank you.
- All right. Can you get up?

437
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:28,038
- Yes.
- Yeah?

438
00:27:28,071 --> 00:27:29,298
Henry, let's go. Let's go, Henry.

439
00:27:29,324 --> 00:27:31,196
- And you? Can you walk?
- I think so.

440
00:27:35,157 --> 00:27:37,298
Come on. Come on. I got you. I got you.

441
00:27:38,078 --> 00:27:39,336
You okay?

442
00:27:45,358 --> 00:27:46,905
- I got him!
- Oh, my God! Hurry!

443
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:49,960
I got him. I got him. I got him.
I got him. Come here. Come here.

444
00:27:49,986 --> 00:27:51,378
I got you. I got you.

445
00:27:51,404 --> 00:27:52,569
Let's go.

446
00:27:55,588 --> 00:27:57,592
There you go. Come on.

447
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:00,663
There you go.

448
00:28:00,689 --> 00:28:03,092
There you go. Close that door.

449
00:28:08,997 --> 00:28:10,202
You okay?

450
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,428
Look.

451
00:28:14,295 --> 00:28:15,780
Bad idea.

452
00:28:22,162 --> 00:28:23,645
Hey, what happened?

453
00:28:24,629 --> 00:28:26,535
It was a long night.

454
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:29,238
For everyone, it seems.

455
00:28:33,772 --> 00:28:35,273
I fucking told you.

456
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,859
Donna, can we...

457
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,163
You can. I'll put you
in a room upstairs.

458
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:46,631
Are you okay?

459
00:28:46,765 --> 00:28:47,788
Yes.

460
00:28:47,888 --> 00:28:49,359
- Yeah.
- Come on.

461
00:28:58,475 --> 00:28:59,873
That poor girl.

462
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:01,256
Nicky's gonna be all right.

463
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:04,034
No. I'm not talking about Nicky.

464
00:29:04,454 --> 00:29:06,102
I'm talking about Fatima.

465
00:29:07,483 --> 00:29:09,431
That horrible bird.

466
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:14,908
What if it was a sign?

467
00:29:20,942 --> 00:29:22,448
What's wrong?

468
00:29:24,865 --> 00:29:26,096
Am I awake?

469
00:29:35,778 --> 00:29:37,247
Where are you going?

470
00:29:53,164 --> 00:29:54,993
Help me.

471
00:29:56,102 --> 00:29:59,188
- Please.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

472
00:30:08,069 --> 00:30:09,543
Can you see anything?

473
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,106
No.

474
00:30:13,151 --> 00:30:14,676
What if they don't come back?

475
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:17,684
Don't think like that.

476
00:30:19,173 --> 00:30:20,566
They'll come back.

477
00:30:23,385 --> 00:30:24,615
Julie,

478
00:30:25,738 --> 00:30:27,431
what happened to you?

479
00:30:29,192 --> 00:30:30,575
What do you mean?

480
00:30:31,693 --> 00:30:34,740
Ever since you fell asleep
and your eyes got all white,

481
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,826
you've been different.

482
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,474
Are you sure you're okay?

483
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:45,422
Yeah.

484
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:47,578
Yeah. I'm fine.

485
00:30:50,111 --> 00:30:51,641
I don't believe you.

486
00:30:52,033 --> 00:30:55,391
You know I'm not a baby anymore.
You can tell me things.

487
00:31:00,285 --> 00:31:01,703
You wanna know the truth?

488
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:07,152
I'm really scared.

489
00:31:10,751 --> 00:31:14,532
I saw things that I don't
really understand.

490
00:31:15,002 --> 00:31:17,446
There's things that I
can't even remember.

491
00:31:18,986 --> 00:31:22,650
All I remember is being more scared
than I've ever been in my entire life.

492
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,454
And that's the truth.

493
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,353
I haven't told anybody but you.

494
00:31:32,128 --> 00:31:34,056
I'm trying really hard to be okay.

495
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:36,759
Can I help?

496
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:41,233
Hey, I'm the big sister here.

497
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:43,111
I'm the one who takes care of you.

498
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,595
If they don't come back,

499
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,797
it'll just be us.

500
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,665
We have to start taking care
of each other from now on.

501
00:32:00,915 --> 00:32:02,520
They'll come back.

502
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,262
So, the rod was through his eye?

503
00:32:08,121 --> 00:32:10,895
Only when he was on the tree. When he...

504
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:14,528
walked up to me with a skull
full of blood, it was just a...

505
00:32:15,356 --> 00:32:17,176
a bloody, empty socket.

506
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:18,853
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

507
00:32:18,879 --> 00:32:21,315
So, that's what my
life's been like lately.

508
00:32:22,113 --> 00:32:24,340
How long has this been going on for?

509
00:32:24,847 --> 00:32:26,395
The hallucinating?

510
00:32:26,872 --> 00:32:28,590
Pretty much since I got here.

511
00:32:30,206 --> 00:32:32,083
Do you remember that day I took
you down to the root cellar,

512
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:34,910
told you I saw that symbol up on the
ceiling? You thought I was crazy?

513
00:32:42,148 --> 00:32:43,340
Tian-Chen

514
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,129
saw me in the diner.

515
00:32:47,917 --> 00:32:50,393
I was drawing the symbol over
and over again, losing my mind,

516
00:32:50,523 --> 00:32:52,386
and first, she made me tea.

517
00:32:53,076 --> 00:32:56,581
And then she took me back into
the storage room, and she...

518
00:32:58,789 --> 00:33:00,478
she pulled out this.

519
00:33:03,396 --> 00:33:05,440
Still have no idea how
she knew it was there.

520
00:33:08,392 --> 00:33:10,394
My mom knew every inch
of that storage room.

521
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:16,464
You know, I thought I was smart enough
to figure this place out, and...

522
00:33:18,794 --> 00:33:20,206
I should have...

523
00:33:21,395 --> 00:33:22,651
Fuck.

524
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,081
She really liked you, you know?

525
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:28,464
My mom.

526
00:33:30,683 --> 00:33:32,815
I think she tolerated
me more than anything.

527
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:36,308
No, no, no. I mean, she really...

528
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,478
She only frowned at
people that she liked.

529
00:33:41,504 --> 00:33:43,745
I mean, the people that
she didn't, she just...

530
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:45,963
ignored.

531
00:33:56,265 --> 00:33:57,824
When you finish that letter,

532
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,542
tell her we all say hi.

533
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:12,101
Jesus.

534
00:34:16,205 --> 00:34:19,355
Are you sure those things you
saw today were hallucinations?

535
00:34:43,942 --> 00:34:46,376
This belonged to Mr. Gerber.

536
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:51,683
He always smelled like onions.

537
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,285
They grow wild in the woods,

538
00:34:53,311 --> 00:34:55,934
so he would pick them and eat them raw.

539
00:35:24,227 --> 00:35:27,077
This was from Delores.

540
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:33,976
She always cried lots.

541
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:47,486
What's wrong?

542
00:35:49,812 --> 00:35:51,731
Nothing for Christopher.

543
00:35:52,298 --> 00:35:53,705
Who was Christopher?

544
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,208
He was our friend.

545
00:36:00,973 --> 00:36:03,622
He was nice, but then he
started seeing the symbol,

546
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:08,145
and then he started getting scary.

547
00:36:12,888 --> 00:36:13,911
What?

548
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,432
No. This was a mistake. I don't
want to do this anymore.

549
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:21,216
- Victor.
- No! I said no!

550
00:36:21,242 --> 00:36:23,028
- Victor!
- I said no!

551
00:36:23,054 --> 00:36:26,013
- Victor!
- No, no, no, no!

552
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:27,508
- Victor!
- No, no!

553
00:36:27,534 --> 00:36:29,145
- Victor! Victor!
- No, no!

554
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,895
- It's okay.
- No.

555
00:36:35,506 --> 00:36:37,559
You don't have to be afraid.

556
00:36:40,245 --> 00:36:42,802
I'm the scariest person
in town, remember?

557
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:48,817
I know what's missing.

558
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:52,950
Hello, Victor!

559
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:55,949
His name was Jasper.

560
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,247
I...

561
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,692
I left him.

562
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:05,552
I just...

563
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:08,393
I just fucking left.

564
00:37:08,419 --> 00:37:09,872
Oh, my God, Boyd.

565
00:37:10,114 --> 00:37:13,614
You know, I couldn't... I...
I tried to save everybody.

566
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,338
What the fuck was Tabitha doing in
the back of that goddamn ambulance?

567
00:37:20,457 --> 00:37:21,681
How did she...

568
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:26,937
Are you sure he's
really Victor's father?

569
00:37:28,215 --> 00:37:32,489
Jim, I stood in the house
that Victor grew up in.

570
00:37:33,536 --> 00:37:34,809
Jesus.

571
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,647
His mother, Miranda,

572
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:40,717
she saw this place before
she even got here.

573
00:37:40,743 --> 00:37:42,966
She had these paintings and...

574
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:50,515
I think that was the reason
why I was sent there.

575
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,132
The little boy in the tower
I think he wanted me to

576
00:37:54,158 --> 00:37:56,664
see something, find something.

577
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,226
And I tried.

578
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:01,519
I just...

579
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,421
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

580
00:38:06,038 --> 00:38:08,531
You have nothing to be sorry about.

581
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,531
You are back, and you are safe.

582
00:38:11,648 --> 00:38:13,542
And that is all that matters.

583
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,781
But...

584
00:38:18,801 --> 00:38:21,796
But what if that was our
only chance to go home?

585
00:38:28,928 --> 00:38:31,148
- Is she all right?
- Oh, shit.

586
00:38:31,174 --> 00:38:32,216
Nicky?

587
00:38:32,242 --> 00:38:34,234
- What's wrong with her?
- No.

588
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,625
Oh, my God. What is...

589
00:38:35,703 --> 00:38:37,816
- What...
- She's bleeding internally.

590
00:38:37,842 --> 00:38:39,872
The bullet must have done
more damage than I...

591
00:38:39,898 --> 00:38:42,351
Nicky, Nicky, Nicky, stay with me, okay?

592
00:38:42,377 --> 00:38:43,578
You're okay.

593
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,390
- Nicky? Shit.
- Come on, Nicky.

594
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:48,757
Come on.

595
00:38:50,336 --> 00:38:53,007
Nicky, stay with me! Nicky?

596
00:38:53,096 --> 00:38:54,586
- No.
- Oh, no.

597
00:38:54,702 --> 00:38:55,718
Come on.

598
00:38:58,138 --> 00:39:00,218
Shit. Come on.

599
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,772
Come on.

600
00:39:03,652 --> 00:39:04,835
Come on.

601
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:07,382
- Nicky?
- Jesus.

602
00:39:11,626 --> 00:39:12,812
Oh, no.

603
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:23,737
You see what you've done?

604
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,572
It was an accident.

605
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:27,888
What's wrong with you, Officer?

606
00:39:28,411 --> 00:39:31,581
Something scares you, you just
start shooting? Is that right?

607
00:39:31,607 --> 00:39:33,622
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry? You're sorry?

608
00:39:33,658 --> 00:39:34,878
Come tell Nicky you're sorry!

609
00:39:34,904 --> 00:39:37,279
- Come on now.
- Get the fuck off me!

610
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,482
- Listen!
- You come with me right fucking now!

611
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,780
God!

612
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:45,083
God!

613
00:39:50,146 --> 00:39:51,607
Shut the door.

614
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:54,568
Look. I'm not really in the
mood for a lecture right now,

615
00:39:54,594 --> 00:39:56,544
so if all we're gonna do...

616
00:39:57,416 --> 00:39:58,560
Donna?

617
00:40:00,496 --> 00:40:02,513
Why is this happening?

618
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:08,263
Why is it just one thing
after another after another?

619
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,005
Why can't they stop?

620
00:40:11,933 --> 00:40:14,466
Why can't they leave us alone?

621
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:16,396
I don't know. I don't know.

622
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:21,826
Oh, Boyd, I am so fucking scared.

623
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,341
I'm so fucking scared.

624
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:27,452
All right.

625
00:40:30,988 --> 00:40:33,658
Jasper belonged to Christopher.

626
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,216
He used to be so much fun.

627
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:41,880
Christopher would make us all laugh.

628
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:46,599
And people didn't laugh much back then,

629
00:40:47,177 --> 00:40:50,576
so it was very nice that we could.

630
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:55,579
But then Christopher
started seeing the symbol,

631
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,622
and he changed.

632
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,591
He didn't make us laugh anymore.

633
00:41:06,845 --> 00:41:08,508
I remember...

634
00:41:09,696 --> 00:41:13,578
Christopher started spending
more and more time alone.

635
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,328
And one day...

636
00:41:42,503 --> 00:41:45,488
Jasper's the one who can
tell us why it happened.

637
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,147
Thanks.

638
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:08,909
I was so mean to her the other day.

639
00:42:08,935 --> 00:42:10,191
Nah.

640
00:42:10,593 --> 00:42:13,555
Every single person in this
house has been on edge lately.

641
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:16,542
Yeah, but I just think I'm gonna
sit with her for a little bit.

642
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:19,790
- Yeah. Do you want me to stay?
- No. I think I want to do this alone.

643
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:21,600
Okay.

644
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,875
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

645
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,528
Okay.

646
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,580
Better fuckin' days.

647
00:44:29,606 --> 00:44:30,962
Hear, hear.
