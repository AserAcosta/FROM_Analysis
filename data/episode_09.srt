00:00:00,898 --> 00:00:02,293
Previously on From...

2
00:00:02,298 --> 00:00:03,630
Still can't afford to buy a boat.

3
00:00:03,634 --> 00:00:05,730
You know what they used to
call me in the army, right?

4
00:00:05,734 --> 00:00:08,447
- Mr. Fish and Loaves.
- That's right! That's right!

5
00:00:08,452 --> 00:00:10,762
No matter what the resources,
I would make it work.

6
00:00:10,767 --> 00:00:12,801
- Dad!
- Oh!

7
00:00:13,397 --> 00:00:15,182
Welcome to your worst nightmare.

8
00:00:16,797 --> 00:00:19,497
It's Mom. I think this
place is starting to get to her.

9
00:00:19,502 --> 00:00:20,779
You've been going out
there for weeks now,

10
00:00:20,783 --> 00:00:22,232
and you're not seeing
what's happening here.

11
00:00:22,236 --> 00:00:24,879
Help your Mom get everybody
secured, tucked away.

12
00:00:24,884 --> 00:00:27,887
And when I get home
tonight, we will talk.

13
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:29,129
I promise.

14
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,287
The only way for us to go home

15
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:41,645
is to wake everyone up.

16
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,903
Abby, stop!

17
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:45,099
I found something, s-something
I think is gonna help us.

18
00:00:45,103 --> 00:00:46,583
Mom!

19
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,622
No, no!

20
00:00:48,627 --> 00:00:50,498
They're in the house!

21
00:00:53,696 --> 00:00:54,864
We have to go.

22
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:57,372
Go where? Where are we going?

23
00:00:57,377 --> 00:00:58,900
You go first.

24
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:00,598
I'll follow you down.

25
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:02,325
We need to get to town.

26
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:05,200
No. We have to go to the trees.

27
00:01:06,075 --> 00:01:07,463
You have to get inside.

28
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:08,676
The tree? No!

29
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:09,682
You'll be safe!

30
00:01:09,687 --> 00:01:10,833
- What?
- I promise.

31
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:12,051
- Go, go!
- No, wait!

32
00:01:12,056 --> 00:01:14,363
Find your brother.
I'll be right behind...

33
00:01:15,974 --> 00:01:18,368
You went through a Farway tree!

34
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:20,426
- Honey...
- What is going on?

35
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:21,590
What's happening?

36
00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:24,162
We're digging a big
hole in the basement.

37
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,137
We're gonna find out where
the electricity comes from.

38
00:01:27,142 --> 00:01:28,578
Is anybody out there?

39
00:01:28,931 --> 00:01:32,090
All I got was some
static, but it worked.

40
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:34,004
I think if we get it
up over the tree line,

41
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:35,208
and we get it enough power,

42
00:01:35,213 --> 00:01:36,649
I think we could get a signal out.

43
00:01:36,654 --> 00:01:38,825
How do you propose we
get up over the tree line?

44
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,817
We start by going to the high ground.

45
00:01:40,822 --> 00:01:42,395
If these voices are real,

46
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,120
if something here is
communicating with you,

47
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,755
then that means you're
connected to this place

48
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,762
in a way that no one else here is.

49
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:49,287
But we need proof.

50
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:50,333
What is this?

51
00:01:50,338 --> 00:01:52,598
They said they watched you bury the bag

52
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:55,519
and that this is proof
that they're real.

53
00:01:55,524 --> 00:01:57,784
I have Sara tied up
in the basement of the church.

54
00:01:57,788 --> 00:01:58,989
Tell me you're joking.

55
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,442
That girl may be the key
to unlocking all this.

56
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:04,723
That girl may be the way we all go home.

57
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:05,904
Let's take a walk.

58
00:02:07,371 --> 00:02:09,242
Where are we going?

59
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:10,989
Find our way home.

60
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:33,288
How do you know this
is the right way to go?

61
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,036
I don't.

62
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,608
I'm just following my best hunch.

63
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,504
Based on what?

64
00:02:44,203 --> 00:02:46,051
Based on that.

65
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:03,140
What is that?

66
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:06,114
I don't know.

67
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,702
No idea.

68
00:03:09,164 --> 00:03:11,688
But it's, uh... It's
where I found these.

69
00:03:12,155 --> 00:03:13,780
Okay.

70
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,592
We're gonna camp out here for the night.

71
00:03:16,749 --> 00:03:18,194
But it's not dark yet.

72
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,115
Hey, look, this right here
is as far as I've ever gotten.

73
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:23,194
Once we go beyond this point,

74
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,132
we're in completely uncharted territory,

75
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:27,487
and I'm not about to do
that two hours before dark.

76
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:30,589
We camp here. Go inside.

77
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:32,912
Will you at least take these off?

78
00:03:33,043 --> 00:03:34,507
No.

79
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:37,062
I have to go to the bathroom.

80
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:38,851
Well, that's why I cuffed you in front.

81
00:03:38,993 --> 00:03:40,624
Don't go far.

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,968

91
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:37,522
Hey, you.

92
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:38,883
Hey.

93
00:04:38,888 --> 00:04:41,405
I, uh, finished Chapter 6.

94
00:04:42,023 --> 00:04:43,023
You're up.

95
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:44,508
What do you think so far?

96
00:04:44,513 --> 00:04:46,038
Well, it's not exactly my favorite,

97
00:04:46,043 --> 00:04:48,288
but I'm interested to
see how things turn out.

98
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:50,460
You think there's
gonna be a happy ending?

99
00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:53,140
I don't know. I guess we'll find out.

100
00:04:53,952 --> 00:04:55,491
Get home safe, Sheriff.

101
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,063
You, too.

102
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:06,242
Great work today, everybody.

103
00:05:06,968 --> 00:05:08,624
Come on in.

104
00:05:09,486 --> 00:05:11,488
Hey, you okay?

105
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:14,110
Looking a little long in the face.

106
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:17,162
Oh, uh, that's genetic.

107
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,822
Get a good sleep tonight.
The real work starts tomorrow.

108
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,882
Yes, ma'am.

109
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:28,382
So, livin' in a jail
cell now, that's quaint.

110
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:30,335
It's temporary.

111
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,865
Right. Until we get this
miraculous tower set up

112
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,780
and send our radio
signal out to Neverland.

113
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:39,585
Hey. Cut the shit, all right?

114
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,030
Some of the folks in there need
something to feel good about.

115
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:45,140
Great. Let's play
make-believe. I'm game.

116
00:05:56,936 --> 00:05:59,983
Tabby, are you hungry?
I made some dinner.

117
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:01,257
I'll be right up.

118
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:43,240
Ethan, I told you to pick up the toys!

119
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:57,655
Can somebody grab that, please?

120
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:04,341
Jim?

121
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:11,843
Grab the kids. There's
something's wrong.

122
00:07:13,638 --> 00:07:15,671
Jim, answer me!

123
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:19,319
Jim?

124
00:07:26,627 --> 00:07:27,890
Oh, my God.

126
00:10:18,771 --> 00:10:21,384
He kept saying he was fine.

127
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:25,611
He was making jokes about the tower.

128
00:10:25,616 --> 00:10:28,251
He...

129
00:10:48,537 --> 00:10:51,080
Oh, that's backwards. Flip it.

130
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:53,439
Yeah. Just make sure it's flush.

131
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,793
That's it.

132
00:10:55,124 --> 00:10:56,587
Hey, Kenny.

133
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:59,489
Hey. Jade's all set
up in the kitchen, uh,

134
00:10:59,494 --> 00:11:00,800
with the batteries, and, uh,

135
00:11:00,805 --> 00:11:02,690
I think we've got enough wire
and cords now for the cable.

136
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:05,283
All right, well, we're
gonna need more material

137
00:11:05,288 --> 00:11:07,283
if we wanna get this
tower up high enough.

138
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:10,244
Right. I'll send
people down to the barn.

139
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:11,589
I think there should
be plenty of wood there

140
00:11:11,593 --> 00:11:12,603
for them to scavenge.

141
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:14,267
- All right.
- Cool.

142
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:16,462
Hey, how you doing?

143
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:20,019
Had a rough morning.

144
00:11:20,627 --> 00:11:22,705
Is, uh... Is Eric with you?

145
00:11:23,097 --> 00:11:24,881
I need him to go on a supply run.

146
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:30,390
Eric's not coming.

147
00:11:35,835 --> 00:11:37,271
Hey.

148
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:42,733
Mind if I join you?

149
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,858
I would not mind at all.

150
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,279
Hey.

151
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:57,939
You hear about Eric?

152
00:11:57,944 --> 00:11:59,619
Yeah.

153
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:02,794
Yeah.

154
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:05,290
I-I didn't see that one coming.

155
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:13,885
It's weird, you know, this
radio might actually work,

156
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:17,369
and as amazing as that is...

157
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,234
I think part of me...

158
00:12:25,082 --> 00:12:27,837
I think the idea that it might work

159
00:12:27,842 --> 00:12:30,775
is scarier than the idea that it won't.

160
00:12:31,305 --> 00:12:32,853
What do you mean?

161
00:12:33,613 --> 00:12:36,006
I keep thinking...

162
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:41,064
"How do we go back now?"

163
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:47,297
After everything we've seen,
some of the things we've done,

164
00:12:47,302 --> 00:12:48,651
how do we just...

165
00:12:51,276 --> 00:12:53,626
And even if we can go back, how do...

166
00:12:55,805 --> 00:12:58,439
I'm not sure we can ever really go home.

167
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,330
We're not the same people anymore.

168
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:11,533
You know, when my dad...

169
00:13:11,953 --> 00:13:14,533
came back home from Afghanistan,

170
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:20,373
he said that that coming
home from war is like...

171
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,377
it's like traveling from another planet.

172
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,572
And then when you come back,

173
00:13:25,577 --> 00:13:29,111
you can't tell if
everything is different

174
00:13:29,213 --> 00:13:32,129
than it was when you left it or... or...

175
00:13:33,423 --> 00:13:35,259
or if it's you,

176
00:13:37,103 --> 00:13:39,158
if you're the one that's changed.

177
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:43,283
What's it gonna be like for us?

178
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,775
This is the only place
we've ever known together.

179
00:13:56,188 --> 00:13:58,408
I'll be right back.

180
00:13:58,677 --> 00:13:59,809
Where you going?

181
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:04,487
Go find a sharper knife.

182
00:14:04,492 --> 00:14:06,146
This one's just taking forever.

183
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:14,213
Hey. Hold up a sec.

184
00:14:18,836 --> 00:14:20,423
What are you doing?

185
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:24,892
Making sure we find our way back.

186
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,656
All right, let's go.

187
00:14:41,902 --> 00:14:44,513
How do you know
it's not just like the road?

188
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,746
What's that?

189
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,915
It just goes in one big loop

190
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,792
and then brings you back to town.

191
00:14:52,502 --> 00:14:55,072
How do you know this isn't the same?

192
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,787
How do you know we
won't just walk and...

193
00:14:59,206 --> 00:15:00,700
walk and walk,

194
00:15:00,705 --> 00:15:04,497
and then end up right back
in town where we started?

195
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:06,138
I don't.

196
00:15:06,988 --> 00:15:09,005
Guess we'll see.

197
00:15:11,498 --> 00:15:13,326
Let me ask you a question.

198
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:15,646
You say those voices told you

199
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:19,153
that killing those people
would get everyone home.

200
00:15:19,664 --> 00:15:21,623
You ever stop to think
that maybe they were lying?

201
00:15:21,627 --> 00:15:24,825
- I don't want to talk about that.
- Wait, wait, wait.

202
00:15:26,423 --> 00:15:28,382
I think, if we're gonna
start second-guessing

203
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:31,216
each other's decisions,
then that seems like

204
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,136
a fair question to ask.

205
00:15:33,587 --> 00:15:35,927
So, what is it? What exactly

206
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:39,271
did they tell you that made you
willing to kill that little boy?

207
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:42,080
You wouldn't understand.

208
00:15:42,248 --> 00:15:43,660
Try me.

209
00:15:44,905 --> 00:15:46,982
They told me...

210
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:49,732
that those people were coming.

211
00:15:49,737 --> 00:15:52,200
They told me that
there would be two cars!

212
00:15:52,205 --> 00:15:55,880
And they said that if I
didn't do what they said...

213
00:15:56,809 --> 00:15:58,376
Then what?

214
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,511
If you didn't do what
they said, then what?

215
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:04,903
Hey, let me explain to
you again how this works.

216
00:16:04,908 --> 00:16:07,216
I say jump, you jump.

217
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:10,017
I ask you a question,
then you goddamn answer...

218
00:16:10,022 --> 00:16:13,155
They said my brother would die, okay?!

219
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,005
They said that if I didn't do it,

220
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,294
that he would die,
that everyone would die!

221
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:33,271
Why didn't you just put me in the box?

222
00:16:33,276 --> 00:16:36,263
I don't know! I thought...

223
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:41,235
Hey.

224
00:16:53,194 --> 00:16:57,583
I've seen this town make good people...

225
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,169
do bad things.

226
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,231
Let's keep moving.

227
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,757
I don't understand.

228
00:17:27,762 --> 00:17:29,803
Ethan said he thinks it's a puzzle.

229
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:31,569
No, not a puzzle.

230
00:17:31,574 --> 00:17:33,077
A story.

231
00:17:33,082 --> 00:17:35,450
They all fit together and tell a story.

232
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,491
And once we figure out the story,

233
00:17:37,496 --> 00:17:39,561
we'll know what to do next.

234
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:41,663
That's how it works.

235
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:45,444
Yeah, um, I think we
should stop seeing these.

236
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:46,983
But we have to.

237
00:17:46,988 --> 00:17:50,647
We can't finish the quest
unless we figure out the story.

238
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,257
I'm not scared, I promise.

239
00:17:53,262 --> 00:17:54,698
I know.

240
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:58,243
Do you think Dad's tower's gonna work?

241
00:17:58,248 --> 00:18:01,608
I don't know. I mean, we'll
just have to wait and see.

242
00:18:03,055 --> 00:18:04,970
Where do you think this one goes?

243
00:18:04,975 --> 00:18:07,374
Oh, yeah, this is super healthy.

244
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:08,672
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Okay.

245
00:18:08,676 --> 00:18:11,549
Okay. We should... We should stop.

246
00:18:12,137 --> 00:18:14,600
Um, maybe we should play another game.

247
00:18:14,605 --> 00:18:16,483
What kind of game?

248
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,288
Um...

249
00:18:19,293 --> 00:18:20,960
Okay.

250
00:18:21,592 --> 00:18:24,569
A game called "When I get home, I..."

251
00:18:24,574 --> 00:18:26,494
And we just say whatever
we're looking forward to

252
00:18:26,499 --> 00:18:28,152
the most about getting home.

253
00:18:28,395 --> 00:18:29,928
I'll start.

254
00:18:30,672 --> 00:18:33,225
When I get home, I...

255
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:37,507
I will go to Giovelli's

256
00:18:37,512 --> 00:18:39,905
and I will order...

257
00:18:40,627 --> 00:18:42,498
everything on that menu.

258
00:18:42,503 --> 00:18:44,723
Maybe two of everything on the menu.

259
00:18:45,394 --> 00:18:46,917
Your turn, Jules.

260
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:48,288
This is stupid.

261
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,257
Oh, come on, Jules.

262
00:18:50,302 --> 00:18:51,483
Fine.

263
00:18:51,488 --> 00:18:56,030
When I get home, I'm going to, um...

264
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,763
I'm gonna call my friends and...

265
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,725
I'm just gonna call them.

266
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,436
What about you?

267
00:19:09,236 --> 00:19:12,195
When I get home, I...

268
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,655
I want us to be happy, like we are here.

269
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:19,112
We never play games
around the table at home.

270
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:28,507
Okay, look,

271
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:32,342
most of these batteries are
way past their expiration date.

272
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:34,572
All right, we've got the
newer batteries from my car

273
00:19:34,577 --> 00:19:38,467
and that giant lunchbox that
you guys were driving, but...

274
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,562
even those'd drain in a couple of hours.

275
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:44,717
We need something that'll
keep this running for days

276
00:19:44,722 --> 00:19:48,046
or weeks, right? Not hours.

277
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:50,100
What we do is we-we take the batteries,

278
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,887
we put 'em in the cars and
then we just run the cars

279
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:52,892
to recharge them.

280
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:54,827
And then what? Burn how much fuel?

281
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:56,616
Look, the point is,
you're either burning out

282
00:19:56,621 --> 00:19:57,944
one vital resource or another,

283
00:19:57,949 --> 00:20:00,343
which would be fine if
this was guaranteed to work,

284
00:20:00,348 --> 00:20:02,068
but let's be honest,
man, it probably won't!

285
00:20:02,073 --> 00:20:03,663
Hey. Keep it down.

286
00:20:13,303 --> 00:20:14,936
Has anyone seen Victor?

287
00:20:15,744 --> 00:20:18,873
Look, if you would just
take a look at the symbol.

288
00:20:18,878 --> 00:20:20,491
Open the book!

289
00:20:20,496 --> 00:20:22,100
What is wrong with you?

290
00:20:23,392 --> 00:20:26,221
We have a legitimate chance
here to go home and you're...

291
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:33,546
You know what? Just go.

292
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:36,147
Go. Go, go find Victor.

293
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,154
Do whatever you want.

294
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,597
I'll stay here, and I'll
figure this out myself.

295
00:20:41,772 --> 00:20:43,932
There's nothing to figure
out. There's no power source.

296
00:20:46,298 --> 00:20:47,686
Jim, this isn't Gilligan's Island.

297
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:49,898
You're not gonna build a radio
with palm leaves and coconuts.

298
00:20:49,902 --> 00:20:52,389
Maybe you're not as smart
as you think you are.

299
00:20:57,054 --> 00:20:58,446
Whatever.

300
00:21:13,491 --> 00:21:15,797
What do you want?

301
00:21:15,877 --> 00:21:18,271
I, uh... I heard what happened.

302
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,616
You okay?

303
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:23,189
Not my bathroom the
asshole hung himself in.

304
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:28,227
Shouldn't you be out there

305
00:21:28,232 --> 00:21:30,405
rounding up supplies
or building a spaceship

306
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,441
or some shit?

307
00:21:31,446 --> 00:21:33,327
I'm just saying, if...

308
00:21:33,511 --> 00:21:35,467
if you want someone to talk to...

309
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:37,952
Oh, so, now you're sheriff,

310
00:21:37,957 --> 00:21:40,176
you're gonna start doling
out words of wisdom?

311
00:21:40,426 --> 00:21:42,624
One thing I always
appreciated about Boyd

312
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:44,457
is he minded his own business.

313
00:21:47,668 --> 00:21:50,303
Well, I'm gonna take a few
people down to the barn,

314
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:52,335
salvage some more wood for the tower.

315
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,317
Maybe if you want to...

316
00:21:54,322 --> 00:21:56,851
come with us or... I don't know.

317
00:21:56,856 --> 00:21:58,205
You want wood?

318
00:21:59,453 --> 00:22:01,741
We got plenty of wood.

319
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,340
Where are you going?

320
00:22:03,673 --> 00:22:05,458
Let's get wood!

321
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:08,186
Donna!

322
00:22:08,534 --> 00:22:09,921
Come on!

323
00:22:09,926 --> 00:22:11,797
I'm saving you a trip!

324
00:22:11,802 --> 00:22:13,281
Donna!

325
00:22:17,096 --> 00:22:19,273
Donna! Hey!

326
00:22:21,624 --> 00:22:22,930
Hey!

327
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,538
Donna!

328
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,436
Donna! Hey!

329
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:27,843
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

330
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,008
- Hey!
- Donna, wait, wait, wait!

331
00:22:29,012 --> 00:22:31,264
Oh, calm the fuck down!
I'm not a fuckin' psycho.

332
00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:34,132
You said we needed wood? Let's get wood.

333
00:22:34,137 --> 00:22:35,741
Wha...? Okay.

334
00:22:38,075 --> 00:22:39,921
Donna, please.

335
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:42,483
Better here than any
of that half-rotten shit

336
00:22:42,488 --> 00:22:44,616
you're gonna pull off the barn.

337
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:48,526
You gonna get her to
stop or you want me to?

338
00:22:48,531 --> 00:22:51,210
Donna, stop! We need...
We need this place intact.

339
00:22:51,215 --> 00:22:53,217
For what? Huh?

340
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,462
We're all going home, right?

341
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:57,861
We don't need this place anymore.

342
00:22:57,866 --> 00:23:00,999
Your glorious tower's
gonna get us all home.

343
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:03,686
No need to keep this place standing.

344
00:23:04,157 --> 00:23:07,857
It's not a home anymore.
It's a fucking tomb!

345
00:23:08,957 --> 00:23:11,296
The fuck!

346
00:23:11,521 --> 00:23:12,740
Fuck!

347
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:23,288
Look, can we please...

348
00:23:23,293 --> 00:23:25,008
Can we please just take
a minute and let's...

349
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:26,012
Fuck off!

350
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,474
Aw, fuck!

351
00:23:34,868 --> 00:23:38,335
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

352
00:23:58,884 --> 00:24:02,235
It was nice that Ellis came
to see you before you left.

353
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,179
I'm sure he appreciates
what you're doing.

354
00:24:08,312 --> 00:24:10,750
I heard the story about
what happened with your wife,

355
00:24:11,538 --> 00:24:12,790
what you had to do.

356
00:24:12,795 --> 00:24:14,710
We're not gonna talk about that.

357
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,909
That's okay.

358
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,264
We don't have to. It's...

359
00:24:20,255 --> 00:24:22,796
It's just, in some ways...

360
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:26,483
you remind me of Nathan.

361
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:30,780
I mean, you're a lot
more gruff than he was.

362
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:34,757
But you always put other
people's needs before your own.

363
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:36,732
That's how he ended up here.

364
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,014
I don't think he'd like
what we're doing now.

365
00:24:40,276 --> 00:24:41,712
And why is that?

366
00:24:41,717 --> 00:24:44,305
Nathan had a theory about this place.

367
00:24:44,562 --> 00:24:48,435
If we tried to leave,
if we pushed too hard,

368
00:24:49,018 --> 00:24:51,150
then something would push back.

369
00:24:58,085 --> 00:24:59,377
What is that?

370
00:25:02,842 --> 00:25:04,189
I don't know.

371
00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:17,904
Are you sure it was
coming from this direction?

372
00:25:21,793 --> 00:25:23,217
Let's go.

373
00:25:35,613 --> 00:25:38,093
I thought you said no one
had been out this far before.

374
00:25:40,977 --> 00:25:42,494
No.

375
00:25:48,234 --> 00:25:49,452
What are you doing?

376
00:25:49,457 --> 00:25:52,358
Look, there's something inside them.

377
00:25:53,155 --> 00:25:56,389
We gotta get one down. Just, uh...

378
00:25:57,025 --> 00:25:58,766
Are you sure that's a good idea?

379
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:00,650
Maybe we should...

380
00:26:02,864 --> 00:26:04,405
Hey, what's wrong?

381
00:26:06,116 --> 00:26:07,361
Whoa, Sara.

382
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:08,906
Ow!

383
00:26:08,911 --> 00:26:11,953
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, you're okay.

384
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:13,215
- You're okay.
- Ow!

385
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,496
Look at me, Sara. You're okay.

386
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:16,189
No! No!

387
00:26:16,194 --> 00:26:17,867
Look... What's going on?

388
00:26:17,872 --> 00:26:18,873
Sara! Sara!

389
00:26:20,637 --> 00:26:22,225
I can hear them! I can...

390
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,579
No, no. Talk to me.

391
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:25,227
Talk to me. Talk to me.

392
00:26:25,232 --> 00:26:27,002
No, no, no, no!

393
00:26:29,061 --> 00:26:31,446
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no! Don't, don't! No, no!

394
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:33,757
No. Sara? No, no, no. Okay.

395
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,882
No, Sara! Sara! Hey!

396
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:43,335
How's the magic tower coming?

397
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,253
You know, all the time I've been here,

398
00:26:51,258 --> 00:26:53,788
this is first you've
set foot in this place.

399
00:26:56,568 --> 00:27:00,444
Because you serve piss water.
Your distilling is for shit.

400
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:02,835
At least here, I can be alone.

401
00:27:05,331 --> 00:27:06,806
Oh.

402
00:27:06,811 --> 00:27:08,569
Kinda feels like a banner day today.

403
00:27:08,574 --> 00:27:10,647
Feel like I'm holding court.

404
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:13,085
You mind giving us a second?

405
00:27:13,914 --> 00:27:15,303
Yeah.

406
00:27:16,342 --> 00:27:18,077
I'll leave this here.

407
00:27:18,321 --> 00:27:20,530
Give me a holler if
you need anything, okay?

408
00:27:26,373 --> 00:27:28,303
Are you okay?

409
00:27:31,423 --> 00:27:33,077
Donna, I know you're upset about Eric,

410
00:27:33,082 --> 00:27:34,867
but there's nothing you could have...

411
00:27:34,872 --> 00:27:37,436
Oh, for fuck's sake,
it's not about that.

412
00:27:39,606 --> 00:27:42,272
Eric punched his own ticket.

413
00:27:43,174 --> 00:27:46,085
Kid's got a right to
go out the way he wants.

414
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:49,947
Why don't you just fuck
off and leave me be.

415
00:27:50,522 --> 00:27:53,061
Go back to your little fantasy land.

416
00:27:53,536 --> 00:27:56,053
You don't think the tower's gonna work.

417
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,564
Do you?

418
00:27:59,569 --> 00:28:04,051
I think it might.
I think it's worth trying.

419
00:28:04,056 --> 00:28:06,389
And what happens when you fail?

420
00:28:08,224 --> 00:28:10,632
- Then we try again.
- No!

421
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:13,595
No, ya stupid little shit.

422
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,908
That's the point. You don't try again,

423
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,502
because you got people's hopes up,

424
00:28:18,507 --> 00:28:19,994
you made them believe.

425
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:22,845
You take that away now and they're lost,

426
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:26,569
they give up, and then they fucking die.

427
00:28:27,901 --> 00:28:31,862
'Cause it isn't some
grade-school softball game

428
00:28:31,867 --> 00:28:34,085
where everyone gets
a participation medal.

429
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,233
You don't know!

430
00:28:36,663 --> 00:28:39,013
You don't remember
what it was like before

431
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:41,467
because you weren't here.

432
00:28:43,949 --> 00:28:46,092
You wanna know what I'm grieving?

433
00:28:46,748 --> 00:28:50,999
I'm grieving the loss of what
we almost made this place.

434
00:28:51,805 --> 00:28:54,938
I'm grieving the fact
that, for a little while,

435
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:57,944
this place almost felt like
something that could work.

436
00:28:57,949 --> 00:29:01,639
I am grieving the fact that
you guys are so caught up

437
00:29:01,644 --> 00:29:04,473
in playing Mr. Fucking
Wizard that you can't see

438
00:29:04,478 --> 00:29:07,296
what this place is gonna
become when you fail.

439
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,881
So, what are we supposed to do?

440
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,796
What are we supposed to do?

441
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:25,095
Just sit here and not try to go home?

442
00:29:26,326 --> 00:29:28,019
Live in a place where
those things come to hunt us

443
00:29:28,023 --> 00:29:29,556
every single night?

444
00:29:30,022 --> 00:29:32,369
Oh, God, the fuck...

445
00:29:32,374 --> 00:29:33,807
Why not?

446
00:29:33,812 --> 00:29:36,238
At least here, the
monsters have the decency

447
00:29:36,243 --> 00:29:38,463
to show you what they are.

448
00:29:43,773 --> 00:29:48,604
I know you guys from
town look at Colony House

449
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:52,014
and figure it's all just
drinking and fucking.

450
00:29:53,222 --> 00:29:55,546
But it was more than that.

451
00:29:56,308 --> 00:29:58,124
It was special.

452
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:03,791
All those people from all
those different places,

453
00:30:03,796 --> 00:30:06,467
different lives,
everyone living together.

454
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:09,146
For all the fear

455
00:30:09,151 --> 00:30:12,067
and all the monsters-in-the-forest
bullshit,

456
00:30:12,072 --> 00:30:13,757
there was something,

457
00:30:13,762 --> 00:30:16,553
there was a joy in that house.

458
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:22,632
For a little while, anyways.

459
00:30:23,897 --> 00:30:26,773
And, like most things,
none of us appreciated it

460
00:30:26,778 --> 00:30:30,413
nearly as much as we should
have, and now it's fucking gone.

461
00:30:38,468 --> 00:30:39,600
I'm sorry.

462
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,327
Yeah.

463
00:30:44,491 --> 00:30:45,797
Me, too.

464
00:30:55,357 --> 00:30:59,013
Look, I'm gonna put my game face

465
00:30:59,018 --> 00:31:00,874
back on tomorrow,

466
00:31:02,037 --> 00:31:04,327
and we'll give that tower a shot.

467
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:12,122
But you have to be prepared for
the fallout if it doesn't work.

468
00:31:12,686 --> 00:31:14,702
And if it does work...

469
00:31:17,562 --> 00:31:20,565
I think you'll find there's
more you're gonna miss

470
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:23,178
about this place than you thought.

471
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:42,466
That kinda day, huh?

472
00:31:46,203 --> 00:31:49,409
Just ironing out a few
wrinkles, that's all.

473
00:31:49,414 --> 00:31:50,727
Yeah.

474
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,902
Where's Jade?

475
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:57,195
He's, uh... I don't know.

476
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:58,786
Okay?

477
00:31:59,526 --> 00:32:01,398
Donna did a number on the floor.

478
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:03,128
Yeah.

479
00:32:03,133 --> 00:32:05,898
She knows how to wield an
axe, I'll give her that.

480
00:32:14,227 --> 00:32:16,984
Well, better get back to it.

481
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:20,456
So, we got that coil for
the CB that you needed,

482
00:32:20,461 --> 00:32:23,193
and we should have enough
wire stripped for the cord.

483
00:32:23,698 --> 00:32:25,526
That's great.

484
00:32:25,531 --> 00:32:26,706
Is it?

485
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:29,180
Well, yeah. I mean, look,

486
00:32:29,185 --> 00:32:31,585
I'm not gonna stand here and
pretend that it was a great day.

487
00:32:32,406 --> 00:32:35,413
These are setbacks, nothing more.

488
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:38,078
Look, you got what
we need for the radio,

489
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:42,250
tower's almost finished, and
I'm gonna figure this out.

490
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:43,776
How?

491
00:32:43,781 --> 00:32:45,699
Well, that I don't know.

492
00:32:45,704 --> 00:32:49,672
But one thing you learn as an
engineer: there's always a way.

493
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,527
We will figure this out.

494
00:33:23,215 --> 00:33:24,433
Hey.

495
00:33:27,692 --> 00:33:29,259
Hey.

496
00:33:29,264 --> 00:33:30,937
Are you okay?

497
00:33:34,932 --> 00:33:36,953
Eric was a friend.

498
00:33:38,394 --> 00:33:41,402
Oh God, I'm... I'm sorry.

499
00:33:41,407 --> 00:33:44,398
I-I didn't know that
you guys were close.

500
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:48,477
He had celiac disease,

501
00:33:49,105 --> 00:33:51,542
so he came to the clinic a lot.

502
00:33:51,547 --> 00:33:53,812
He was always bloated and dehydrated.

503
00:33:55,132 --> 00:33:57,264
I kept telling him to stop eating bread.

504
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:01,552
But he always said things like,
"I'm already in shitsville,"

505
00:34:01,557 --> 00:34:04,266
"now you want me to give up carbs?"

506
00:34:04,904 --> 00:34:07,167
He just had this way
about him, you know?

507
00:34:07,382 --> 00:34:11,477
He was one of the people that,
when I first got here, he...

508
00:34:13,211 --> 00:34:15,219
just made it a lot easier.

509
00:34:17,632 --> 00:34:21,984
And now he's gone, so...

510
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:31,233
Hey, Kristi...

511
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:35,804
Look, I know you've
had a hard time lately,

512
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:39,155
and that this tower
means a lot to everybody,

513
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,766
and you feel like it's
your responsibility now...

514
00:34:41,771 --> 00:34:42,771
Kristi, I...

515
00:34:42,776 --> 00:34:45,367
But I just need you to promise me, okay?

516
00:34:46,979 --> 00:34:51,244
If it falls apart, if you fall apart,

517
00:34:51,781 --> 00:34:55,398
just promise me, you'll come to me,

518
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,305
you'll talk to me,

519
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,051
you'll let me help.

520
00:35:03,972 --> 00:35:05,669
I promise you.

521
00:35:08,413 --> 00:35:11,383
Hey, I promise you.

522
00:35:13,016 --> 00:35:15,370
Come here. Come on.

523
00:35:22,334 --> 00:35:23,820
It's okay.

524
00:35:26,363 --> 00:35:28,297
People just don't
understand what it's like.

525
00:35:29,638 --> 00:35:32,023
I mean, it's not
like you can take a nickel

526
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:35,380
and suddenly make it worth 10 cents!

527
00:35:36,865 --> 00:35:38,693
Aw, it doesn't matter. You know why?

528
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:43,623
Because Jade is a genius.
Jade'll figure it out. You...

529
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:44,907
Let me tell you something,

530
00:35:44,911 --> 00:35:47,783
you have no idea how
much pressure that is,

531
00:35:47,788 --> 00:35:49,007
to be the one that everybody

532
00:35:49,012 --> 00:35:51,758
just assumes can fix a...

533
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:54,752
an unfixable problem!

534
00:35:55,462 --> 00:35:57,281
Oh, and then...

535
00:35:57,286 --> 00:35:59,625
then, you've got Mr. Tea Cups
sauntering in

536
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:05,502
with his big white horse
and his blue eyes and his,

537
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:10,227
"Oh, don't smoke weed, you degenerate."

538
00:36:11,513 --> 00:36:13,472
Fine, fine. You know what? Fine.

539
00:36:13,477 --> 00:36:15,637
You think you can fix
this? Go ahead! Fix it!

540
00:36:15,642 --> 00:36:18,602
I'm just dying to see how it's done. Ha!

541
00:36:20,414 --> 00:36:22,289
You so much complain!

542
00:36:22,602 --> 00:36:24,391
Complain, complain!

543
00:36:24,506 --> 00:36:26,116
Stop complain!

544
00:36:26,121 --> 00:36:29,164
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

545
00:36:29,844 --> 00:36:31,844
You need electric?

546
00:36:32,449 --> 00:36:34,086
Yeah.

547
00:36:46,313 --> 00:36:49,164
The problem is you
can't plug anything in.

548
00:36:51,341 --> 00:36:52,941
I mean, it'd be one
thing if it was just,

549
00:36:52,946 --> 00:36:56,180
you know, like a pan we
could throw on the stove.

550
00:36:56,841 --> 00:36:57,929
God knows,

551
00:36:57,934 --> 00:37:00,641
whatever's coming up through
those wires is still...

552
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,430
Holy shit. I know how to do it.

553
00:37:16,515 --> 00:37:17,603
Hello?

554
00:37:17,608 --> 00:37:19,602
We're down here!

555
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,156
Hi.

556
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:27,076
How did it go with the tower?

557
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:28,634
Uh, good.

558
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,711
I think things are really shaping up.

559
00:37:31,328 --> 00:37:33,250
You're a pretty bad liar.

560
00:37:33,939 --> 00:37:36,766
Thanks. I'll add that to the list.

561
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,297
It's gonna work.

562
00:37:43,308 --> 00:37:46,137
The tower, it's gonna work.

563
00:37:46,408 --> 00:37:48,847
What's got you feeling so optimistic?

564
00:37:48,852 --> 00:37:50,999
I don't know.

565
00:37:51,004 --> 00:37:53,422
I was just thinking about
something Ethan said.

566
00:37:53,427 --> 00:37:55,070
What was that?

567
00:37:55,075 --> 00:37:56,990
What if we were supposed to come here?

568
00:37:57,676 --> 00:37:59,727
I don't know, it's weird, but...

569
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,746
back home, we never talked anymore.

570
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:04,751
We just...

571
00:38:06,187 --> 00:38:07,624
And now, we're together again,

572
00:38:07,629 --> 00:38:09,501
like, we're really together.

573
00:38:09,513 --> 00:38:12,560
And it's...

574
00:38:12,588 --> 00:38:15,172
it's like Fatima said
to me on my first night,

575
00:38:15,483 --> 00:38:17,320
"If you climb up high enough,

576
00:38:17,325 --> 00:38:19,066
even a nightmare can look like a dream."

577
00:38:19,817 --> 00:38:21,645
Wise words.

578
00:38:23,815 --> 00:38:28,164
So, how about you forget about
your tower for a little while

579
00:38:28,169 --> 00:38:30,375
and come help us dig our hole?

580
00:38:33,142 --> 00:38:34,796
Deal.

581
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,562
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

582
00:39:03,567 --> 00:39:07,815
Hey, it's okay. It's okay. Come on.

583
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:13,414
It's okay. It's okay. Come on.

584
00:39:13,419 --> 00:39:15,352
There. There, there you go.

585
00:39:15,357 --> 00:39:16,961
There you go.

586
00:39:17,711 --> 00:39:19,495
I wasn't sure you'd wake up.

587
00:39:22,691 --> 00:39:24,148
Where are we?

588
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,007
Don't worry. We're safe.

589
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,435
Is that...?

590
00:39:31,893 --> 00:39:32,893
Oh, yeah.

591
00:39:32,898 --> 00:39:37,250
I, uh... finally
managed to get one down,

592
00:39:37,255 --> 00:39:40,258
and, uh... this was inside.

593
00:39:41,805 --> 00:39:43,633
What does it say?

594
00:39:43,638 --> 00:39:46,320
1864.

595
00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:48,737
That's it.

596
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:51,539
And, from what I could tell,

597
00:39:52,203 --> 00:39:54,316
every bottle up there seems
to have a slip of paper

598
00:39:54,321 --> 00:39:56,106
just like this.

599
00:39:57,196 --> 00:39:58,937
I think we should go back.

600
00:40:00,124 --> 00:40:01,874
What?

601
00:40:03,496 --> 00:40:05,237
The voice I heard,

602
00:40:05,242 --> 00:40:07,575
it was different this time.

603
00:40:08,141 --> 00:40:11,705
It was a woman and...

604
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,742
and she was screaming.

605
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:15,730
She said...

606
00:40:17,972 --> 00:40:20,516
She said that she was wrong,

607
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:24,674
that we shouldn't have come,
that there are things out here

608
00:40:25,086 --> 00:40:26,894
that are worse than the monsters.

609
00:40:26,899 --> 00:40:29,897
She kept saying...

610
00:40:30,242 --> 00:40:31,942
What? She kept saying what?

611
00:40:32,453 --> 00:40:34,336
I don't know.

612
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,414
It doesn't make any sense.

613
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,820
She kept saying,

614
00:40:39,825 --> 00:40:41,609
"Tell Mr. Fish and Loaves

615
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,635
that I was wrong."

616
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:47,844
What?

617
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,618
What is that?

618
00:40:55,944 --> 00:40:57,367
I don't know.

619
00:41:13,896 --> 00:41:15,463
What's happening?

620
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,768
I don't know.

621
00:41:30,445 --> 00:41:33,187
There's drawings of scarecrows

622
00:41:33,192 --> 00:41:36,449
and bogeymen, giant spiders.

623
00:41:36,454 --> 00:41:38,761
This is definitely a quest.

624
00:41:43,965 --> 00:41:44,966
What is it?

625
00:41:45,673 --> 00:41:47,141
Keep digging, keep digging!

626
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:49,069
I think I hit the bottom.

627
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:50,375
Oh, my God.

628
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,660
Here, here. Let me help.

629
00:41:51,817 --> 00:41:53,203
Hey!

630
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,242
Get in!

631
00:42:04,035 --> 00:42:05,732
Are you... are you...

632
00:42:18,081 --> 00:42:20,387
Hey, where's the talisman?

633
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:24,844
W-where's the talisman?

634
00:42:25,436 --> 00:42:26,656
Here!

635
00:42:42,138 --> 00:42:44,211
- We shouldn't have come here.
- Shh.

636
00:42:44,713 --> 00:42:47,498
We're okay. We're okay.

637
00:42:47,503 --> 00:42:49,211
No.

638
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:51,810
I don't think we are.

639
00:43:14,285 --> 00:43:17,285
