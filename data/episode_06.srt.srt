00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,689
Previously on From...

2
00:00:18,715 --> 00:00:20,184
Are you looking for these?

3
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,738
Take them. We get to
keep Randall, though.

4
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,033
We're gonna need some fresh towels!

5
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,434
- You're gonna hurt yourself.
- You fucking left me!

6
00:00:34,777 --> 00:00:37,892
Ellis, he's so happy.

7
00:00:37,918 --> 00:00:41,173
I can't tell him how scared I am.

8
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:42,691
I'm trying to be patient,

9
00:00:42,717 --> 00:00:44,175
- but I need...
- You can't help!

10
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:45,792
I don't understand.

11
00:00:45,818 --> 00:00:46,909
This.

12
00:00:46,972 --> 00:00:48,717
- It's all I can keep down!
- What?

13
00:00:48,743 --> 00:00:51,121
I think there's something
wrong with the baby.

14
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:55,636
- What's wrong?
- Nothing for Christopher.

15
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,626
- Who was Christopher?
- He was our friend.

16
00:00:58,652 --> 00:01:01,431
But then Christopher
started seeing the symbol,

17
00:01:01,551 --> 00:01:03,386
and then everyone died.

18
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,902
Jasper's the one who can
tell us why it happened.

19
00:01:08,488 --> 00:01:11,337
Easier to tell myself they were dead.

20
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,750
All that time, my little boy was here.

21
00:01:13,776 --> 00:01:16,261
What kind of man gives up on his family?

22
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:20,261
Victor.

23
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:23,066
I didn't know how to get home.

24
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:26,823
What the hell happened last night?

25
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:29,042
- Boyd.
- Tabitha's back.

26
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:30,156
What?

27
00:01:30,182 --> 00:01:32,133
Boyd said you went through a tree?

28
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,712
They're called Farway trees.

29
00:01:33,738 --> 00:01:36,485
Can you get back there without the tree?

30
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:38,524
- I don't know. I don't know.
- What about the bottles?

31
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,173
- Was there anything special about them?
- I took a few of 'em down.

32
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:44,594
There were slips of paper inside
with numbers written on them.

33
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,915
When you were out there,
did you contact anyone?

34
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:49,493
You don't understand, they
wouldn't have believed me.

35
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,397
You had an opportunity that none
of us have ever had before,

36
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:53,774
and you blew it.

37
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,183
I went out and I came back.
And I came back with nothing.

38
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:57,769
We thought you were dead.

39
00:01:58,199 --> 00:02:00,855
Your children thought you were dead.

40
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,784
You owe it to your kids to be here now.

41
00:02:17,364 --> 00:02:18,720
What are you doing?

42
00:02:20,153 --> 00:02:21,655
I had a nightmare.

43
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:26,828
You wanna talk about it?

44
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:28,227
No.

45
00:02:28,653 --> 00:02:30,406
Come back to bed.

46
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:37,414
I should've done more.

47
00:02:38,953 --> 00:02:41,510
When I was out there, I
should've done more.

48
00:03:00,488 --> 00:03:02,413
You did the best you could.

49
00:03:02,963 --> 00:03:04,256
How do you know that?

50
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:06,712
What?

51
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:09,466
You keep saying stuff like that.
How do you know?

52
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:12,429
How do you have any idea
what I could've done?

53
00:03:13,117 --> 00:03:15,841
- I'm just...
- You keep saying stuff like that,

54
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:18,241
just that is not true,
just so I feel better.

55
00:03:18,267 --> 00:03:20,382
I don't understand.

56
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,750
Would you rather I
just picked you apart?

57
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:27,836
Make you feel like shit?

58
00:03:28,447 --> 00:03:30,093
I'm not gonna do that.

59
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:33,140
I just want you to be honest.

60
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:34,343
No.

61
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:38,312
What you want

62
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,571
is for me to read your mind,

63
00:03:40,968 --> 00:03:43,419
so I can say to you
whatever you wanna hear

64
00:03:43,445 --> 00:03:45,161
at any given time.

65
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:47,289
You want me to be the bad guy?

66
00:03:47,422 --> 00:03:48,529
Fine!

67
00:03:48,726 --> 00:03:51,177
But I was the one who stayed here,

68
00:03:51,203 --> 00:03:54,114
holding our kids together,
while you ran off

69
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,552
- to try to deal with whatever...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

70
00:03:55,578 --> 00:03:56,528
it was you were doing!

71
00:03:56,554 --> 00:03:58,880
You make it sound like I
went on a fucking vacation.

72
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,809
I came to you. I asked for
your fucking permission.

73
00:04:01,835 --> 00:04:03,919
I was just trying to save our daughter.

74
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:05,474
Did it ever occur to you that maybe

75
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,419
we could've done things together?

76
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:09,880
No! Because you wanted
to do it on your own!

77
00:04:09,906 --> 00:04:12,039
You want to do everything on your own!

78
00:04:12,132 --> 00:04:14,593
- That's why you...
- That's why what?

79
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,945
- That's why what?
- Nothing.

80
00:04:17,476 --> 00:04:20,678
- Noth... That's why what?
- I'm going back to bed.

81
00:04:20,976 --> 00:04:23,968
Stop being a fucking coward and tell me!

82
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:28,520
That's why you wanted a divorce,

83
00:04:28,546 --> 00:04:31,755
because it'd be easier
for you to cut and run,

84
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:34,357
to deal with Thomas's death on your own,

85
00:04:34,383 --> 00:04:37,716
instead of trying to put
our family back together!

86
00:04:37,742 --> 00:04:40,536
Oh, yeah and you were the
knight in shining armor, right?

87
00:04:40,562 --> 00:04:43,630
Everything you did, every
choice you made was perfect!

88
00:04:43,656 --> 00:04:45,934
- I never said that.
- You think getting the divorce

89
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,606
was gonna let me deal with it on my own?

90
00:04:47,632 --> 00:04:50,145
- I was already on my fucking own!
- Oh, that's so not true.

91
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:52,388
You got to throw
yourself into your work!

92
00:04:52,414 --> 00:04:54,888
You were not there when Julie
and Ethan woke up crying.

93
00:04:54,914 --> 00:04:56,213
You didn't see them

94
00:04:56,238 --> 00:04:59,013
sitting in Thomas's room,
just staring at his toys...

95
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:01,239
- No.
- And you're upset.

96
00:05:01,265 --> 00:05:02,677
You're upset

97
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,914
because you had to take care of your
children the few days that I was gone?

98
00:05:05,991 --> 00:05:08,164
I took care of my fucking
kids for a year,

99
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,695
- while you were doing I don't know
fucking what. - No! God damn it! No!

100
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:24,143
- Where are you going?
- Downstairs!

101
00:05:36,805 --> 00:05:39,257
www.subtitulamos.tv

102
00:07:39,047 --> 00:07:40,375
Hey.

103
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:42,836
You slept late.

104
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:45,539
Where's Dad?

105
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:51,505
He went to the lake with some
people to get the rest of the food.

106
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:52,612
He left?

107
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:54,891
Yeah. He's coming back tomorrow.

108
00:07:55,134 --> 00:07:57,344
Go tell Ethan I'm making breakfast.

109
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:01,376
So we're just taking day
trips to the lake now?

110
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:04,251
Honey, the people need the food.

111
00:08:04,477 --> 00:08:05,485
Right.

112
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:08,376
And it had nothing to do with
that screaming match last night?

113
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,392
I'm sorry you heard that.

114
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:16,212
I'm pretty sure people
in Colony House heard.

115
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:18,727
- Listen, Julie...
- No.

116
00:08:19,295 --> 00:08:22,376
I get it. I've heard this
speech plenty of times.

117
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:27,438
I'm just glad some things are
finally getting back to normal.

118
00:08:28,097 --> 00:08:29,430
I'll get Ethan.

119
00:08:41,963 --> 00:08:46,010
So you're saying this could
be some kind of code?

120
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:49,687
Yeah, or an algorithm, or... who knows?

121
00:08:49,713 --> 00:08:52,523
Look, the fact is, Tabitha got
pushed out of a lighthouse

122
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:55,883
and somehow ended up near a
hiking trail in Camden, Maine.

123
00:08:56,393 --> 00:08:58,351
I don't think I'm being
controversial when I say,

124
00:08:58,377 --> 00:09:00,248
by all known metrics, that's impossible.

125
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,417
- Okay.
- Unless... Unless...

126
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,706
she experienced some kind of...

127
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:06,664
quantum event.

128
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,594
Right? Or wormhole, or any
number of theoretical events

129
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,398
that would allow her to get from
the lighthouse in the woods

130
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:13,845
to Camden, Maine.

131
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:16,104
Or maybe...

132
00:09:17,213 --> 00:09:20,844
Maybe the lighthouse in the
woods occupies the same space

133
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,906
as Camden, Maine.

134
00:09:21,932 --> 00:09:24,883
Maybe it wasn't a wormhole so
much as a dimensional rift!

135
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:27,565
- Jade. - I can understand an
awful lot of people get confused,

136
00:09:27,591 --> 00:09:30,362
but the truth is a wormhole is a
shortcut through space and time.

137
00:09:30,387 --> 00:09:32,729
- Whereas a dimensional rift...
- Jade, stop!

138
00:09:32,893 --> 00:09:34,064
Sorry. What?

139
00:09:34,806 --> 00:09:37,434
I thought you said you had
something exciting to show me.

140
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:39,838
Yeah.

141
00:09:40,737 --> 00:09:42,930
All right, okay, okay, listen, listen.

142
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:46,453
I understand why you might be skeptical.

143
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:47,831
I am too.

144
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:53,008
Something tells me that
this has to mean something.

145
00:09:53,198 --> 00:09:56,554
The bottle tree was important
to Miranda, right?

146
00:09:56,643 --> 00:09:58,973
And according to Tabitha,
she's the only one

147
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,487
who had a connection to this
place long before she arrived.

148
00:10:01,544 --> 00:10:03,745
Did you look at the bottles
from the other tree?

149
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:07,641
What other tree? The one in Maine?

150
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,221
- No. How could I...?
- No, the one...

151
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:11,396
Sara and I found one of these trees

152
00:10:11,422 --> 00:10:13,156
when we went out into
the woods together.

153
00:10:13,182 --> 00:10:14,742
It wasn't a portal tree,

154
00:10:14,768 --> 00:10:17,367
but it still had bottles
hanging from it,

155
00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:20,572
messages inside. I pulled
one down, it said...

156
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,205
1864.

157
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:25,026
1864.

158
00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:26,206
Eighteen.

159
00:10:26,913 --> 00:10:28,362
Eighteen six...

160
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,118
I saw it.

161
00:10:37,202 --> 00:10:38,885
"1864."

162
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:45,252
Where's the second tree?

163
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:55,387
Hey.

164
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,317
Sorry.

165
00:10:57,346 --> 00:11:01,559
I was looking for you and
I just figured I'd wait.

166
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,354
Okay.

167
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:10,619
I haven't seen one of
these in a long time.

168
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,634
Yeah. That belonged to Mrs. Davis.

169
00:11:14,384 --> 00:11:15,593
Is that right?

170
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:19,053
What was Mrs. Davis doing
with one of these?

171
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,088
She bought it for her son,

172
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:22,932
he was very sick,

173
00:11:22,957 --> 00:11:25,447
and he saw the car in
the back of a magazine.

174
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:27,697
And so, she drove

175
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:32,088
far away to buy one from the only store

176
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,189
that still sold them.

177
00:11:38,235 --> 00:11:39,447
She...

178
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,202
She said her son didn't have very long,

179
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:45,455
and she knew that the
car would make him...

180
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,582
smile.

181
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:54,234
She saw the tree before she got home.

182
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:58,453
And she died a long time ago.

183
00:12:00,374 --> 00:12:02,531
I guess her son is dead too.

184
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:10,772
I was thinking maybe

185
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:12,884
you could show me around today.

186
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,249
There's something I have to do.

187
00:12:16,641 --> 00:12:18,827
It's very important.

188
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:22,784
Mind if I tag along?

189
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:26,289
No, I don't think that's a good idea.

190
00:12:27,174 --> 00:12:28,258
Right.

191
00:12:30,258 --> 00:12:32,125
Well, I'll...

192
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,671
- I'll just get out of your way.
- It's...

193
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:42,114
It's... very dangerous,

194
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,795
what I have to do, and I...

195
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:47,405
I don't want you to get hurt.

196
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:57,593
But you could walk with me
for a bit, if you want.

197
00:12:58,825 --> 00:13:01,261
All right. I'd like that.

198
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:02,390
Okay.

199
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:17,032
I finished cleaning out the ambulance.

200
00:13:17,058 --> 00:13:18,110
Here's the last of it.

201
00:13:18,136 --> 00:13:20,174
Awesome. Thanks.

202
00:13:20,285 --> 00:13:22,730
Oh, this stuff is gonna be a godsend.

203
00:13:22,994 --> 00:13:24,679
I'm gonna bring this downstairs.

204
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,222
Oh, I can give you a hand.

205
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:28,379
You've done plenty, really.

206
00:13:29,092 --> 00:13:30,527
You should go home,

207
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:31,946
get some rest.

208
00:13:32,143 --> 00:13:33,311
Thank you.

209
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,658
Coming or going?

210
00:13:45,683 --> 00:13:48,349
Oh, I... going.

211
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,663
You okay?

212
00:13:50,474 --> 00:13:53,030
Yeah. You know, I...

213
00:13:53,995 --> 00:13:55,952
I'm good.
Yeah.

214
00:13:57,202 --> 00:13:58,765
- Kenny...
- I'm good.

215
00:13:59,225 --> 00:14:00,850
I'm good, really.

216
00:14:01,577 --> 00:14:04,063
I don't wanna talk about it right now.

217
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:05,116
Okay.

218
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,796
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

219
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:53,541
Boyd.

220
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:57,313
Shouldn't you be in bed?

221
00:14:57,338 --> 00:15:00,044
I don't think you're one to
talk about taking it easy.

222
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,489
Well...

223
00:15:03,143 --> 00:15:04,489
He's doing better.

224
00:15:05,242 --> 00:15:06,286
Yeah.

225
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:08,303
Yeah. I was...

226
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,029
I was just...

227
00:15:10,685 --> 00:15:13,997
Hey, that ambulance
came in fully stocked.

228
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,499
There was a portable ultrasound onboard.

229
00:15:17,263 --> 00:15:18,815
- Really?
- Yeah.

230
00:15:19,107 --> 00:15:21,567
When you see Fatima,
tell her to come on by.

231
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:24,263
She can take a look
at her little nugget.

232
00:15:25,077 --> 00:15:26,474
I'll do that.

233
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:30,622
Hey, look, don't mention
that I came by, okay?

234
00:15:30,802 --> 00:15:33,028
- Yeah, of course.
- Right.

235
00:15:33,374 --> 00:15:35,833
That's really good news, the ultrasound.

236
00:15:36,332 --> 00:15:37,474
Yeah.

237
00:15:46,506 --> 00:15:47,958
Say something.

238
00:15:50,932 --> 00:15:52,851
We have to go to Kristi.

239
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,334
No.

240
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:57,514
I can't do that.

241
00:16:00,485 --> 00:16:04,255
There's gotta be some sort
of medical explanation.

242
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:05,938
How can there be?

243
00:16:08,805 --> 00:16:09,990
Look, I don't...

244
00:16:10,264 --> 00:16:12,013
I don't want everyone looking at me

245
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:14,311
the way that you're
looking at me right now.

246
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,873
Like you're afraid of me.

247
00:16:17,178 --> 00:16:20,232
No, no, I am not afraid of you.

248
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,724
Okay?

249
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:26,444
And whatever is happening is not
your fault, okay? I just...

250
00:16:27,123 --> 00:16:29,061
I just wanna help you.

251
00:16:29,764 --> 00:16:31,613
Maybe it'll just go away, you know?

252
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:33,746
Maybe it'll just go away on its own.

253
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:35,406
- And maybe...
- Baby...

254
00:16:35,432 --> 00:16:37,226
Maybe it'll just stop.

255
00:16:38,952 --> 00:16:40,138
Who is it?

256
00:16:40,164 --> 00:16:41,319
It's Dad.

257
00:16:41,645 --> 00:16:43,631
I got some good news.

258
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:48,702
Just a second. Just a second.

259
00:16:49,421 --> 00:16:50,505
Hey.

260
00:16:51,369 --> 00:16:53,389
Hey, look at me.

261
00:16:54,908 --> 00:16:57,219
I am just as scared as you.

262
00:16:57,385 --> 00:16:58,491
Okay?

263
00:16:59,448 --> 00:17:01,381
But we cannot do this alone.

264
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:05,904
If it's a bad time...

265
00:17:09,469 --> 00:17:10,845
No, it's fine.

266
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:16,415
Okay.

267
00:17:21,911 --> 00:17:23,189
Hey. What's...

268
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,793
What's going on?

269
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:33,887
Come in.

270
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:00,811
Donna?

271
00:18:03,378 --> 00:18:06,076
I heard about what happened.
I'm so sorry.

272
00:18:08,773 --> 00:18:10,404
Were you two close?

273
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:16,318
He was a pain in my ass
for almost two years.

274
00:18:18,487 --> 00:18:20,631
He had some good moments, though.

275
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:22,643
Would have loved this;

276
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:26,029
me hauling these fucking
stones across town.

277
00:18:26,693 --> 00:18:28,211
Only thing he would've liked better,

278
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:29,797
is if I left him to rot,

279
00:18:29,823 --> 00:18:32,264
so he could ruin everyone's
breakfast every morning.

280
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:36,150
I was there when he went through.

281
00:18:38,613 --> 00:18:40,622
He was just trying to help, you know?

282
00:18:41,382 --> 00:18:44,873
I'm sure he had some shitty
remark on his way out.

283
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,641
You doing okay?

284
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:54,931
Yeah, yeah.

285
00:18:55,576 --> 00:18:58,830
That meeting yesterday
couldn't have been too easy.

286
00:18:59,397 --> 00:19:00,732
Well, I just...

287
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:03,463
I just feel that...

288
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:07,877
everyone expects me to have
all the answers, you know?

289
00:19:09,438 --> 00:19:11,204
I feel like I let them down.

290
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,569
I feel like I let my family down.

291
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:15,049
Let them down?

292
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,972
Tabitha, your children
thought you were dead.

293
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:22,806
They don't need answers from you.

294
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:25,455
They just needed you back.

295
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,097
Yeah.

296
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,740
What if the people from
the meeting were right?

297
00:19:37,474 --> 00:19:39,001
What if I wasted

298
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:41,305
the only opportunity we're gonna get?

299
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:43,438
You see Dale down there?

300
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,970
You went through that same tree.

301
00:19:47,595 --> 00:19:49,446
That could have been you down there.

302
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:51,337
I know.

303
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,079
Don't try to be a hero.

304
00:19:55,678 --> 00:19:57,571
Go spend time with your kids

305
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:00,188
because you're lucky to be here still.

306
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,423
Don't take that for granted.

307
00:20:06,023 --> 00:20:07,274
I'm done.

308
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:12,300
Hey.

309
00:20:14,482 --> 00:20:16,406
I'm sorry about your friend.

310
00:20:21,657 --> 00:20:23,420
- Well, back to work.
- Yeah.

311
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:24,598
You...

312
00:20:24,735 --> 00:20:26,644
tell those kids of yours I said hello.

313
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,813
I will.

314
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:43,410
So you wanna go down into the tunnels,

315
00:20:43,436 --> 00:20:45,324
where these things live?

316
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,100
I don't want to. I have to.

317
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:51,777
Because there's something down there

318
00:20:51,803 --> 00:20:53,670
that is going to help people?

319
00:20:53,696 --> 00:20:57,319
It's going to save them.
It'll save you too.

320
00:20:59,536 --> 00:21:01,022
We're here.

321
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,594
You should go now.

322
00:21:08,403 --> 00:21:10,123
Do you remember the way back?

323
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:13,154
I'm not going back. I'm...

324
00:21:13,235 --> 00:21:15,704
- coming with you.
- No, that's not a good idea.

325
00:21:16,524 --> 00:21:18,189
I just got you back.

326
00:21:18,215 --> 00:21:20,275
I'm not losing you again.

327
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:24,508
If you're gonna do this,
we're doing it together.

328
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:28,396
Okay.

329
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:42,841
What are those for?

330
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:44,702
So we don't get lost.

331
00:21:50,157 --> 00:21:51,708
Follow close.

332
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:57,295
Hey, and be really, really quiet.

333
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:08,626
I mean, we've seen things
here that don't make sense.

334
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:10,267
And...

335
00:22:11,353 --> 00:22:13,319
these cravings,

336
00:22:14,181 --> 00:22:16,181
maybe it's just...

337
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:20,147
I mean, maybe it's just the effect

338
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,174
that this place has on pregnancy,

339
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:25,696
so it doesn't have to mean that there's
something wrong with the baby, right?

340
00:22:25,923 --> 00:22:27,001
Right.

341
00:22:29,054 --> 00:22:30,180
Right.

342
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,999
Kristi has an ultrasound machine.

343
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:39,898
Wait. What?

344
00:22:40,296 --> 00:22:42,835
It was on the ambulance
that came into town.

345
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,812
That's what I came to tell you.

346
00:22:50,761 --> 00:22:51,761
No.

347
00:22:52,714 --> 00:22:55,477
I-I don't... I don't...
I don't wanna.

348
00:22:55,503 --> 00:22:56,948
Could you give us a second?

349
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:59,886
Oh, yeah, of course.

350
00:23:00,332 --> 00:23:01,550
Yeah.

351
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,121
Fatima...

352
00:23:24,147 --> 00:23:26,632
- Ellis, I don't want to see it.
- No, we can't...

353
00:23:31,424 --> 00:23:33,370
We cannot just hope

354
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:35,771
- that this gets better, okay?
- I know.

355
00:23:35,797 --> 00:23:38,011
Okay. We are in the dark.

356
00:23:38,268 --> 00:23:41,061
I know. We'll do it tomorrow.
We'll go tomorrow.

357
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,713
Fatima, Fatima...

358
00:23:47,451 --> 00:23:49,345
- I just want it to be okay.
- I know.

359
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:51,369
It's okay.

360
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:54,885
- I just want it to be okay.
- I know, baby.

361
00:23:57,313 --> 00:23:59,580
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

362
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:01,806
I know.

363
00:24:10,677 --> 00:24:12,283
Good, you're awake.

364
00:24:12,637 --> 00:24:14,275
The fuck do you want?

365
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,580
We need to change your bandages.

366
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:20,346
It's fine.

367
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:23,862
I need to make sure
there's no infection.

368
00:24:24,378 --> 00:24:26,588
That's not something you want, not here.

369
00:24:27,752 --> 00:24:29,718
Fine. I'll fuckin' change 'em.

370
00:24:29,914 --> 00:24:31,564
I need you to sit up.

371
00:24:32,185 --> 00:24:34,112
Please. Come on.

372
00:24:35,693 --> 00:24:38,010
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

373
00:25:05,454 --> 00:25:06,680
May I?

374
00:25:06,894 --> 00:25:07,931
Yeah.

375
00:25:29,563 --> 00:25:30,611
Well?

376
00:25:33,563 --> 00:25:35,419
There's no sign of infection.

377
00:25:35,905 --> 00:25:38,000
And the stitches are holding well.

378
00:25:38,574 --> 00:25:41,243
There's gonna be a lot of
bruising, a lot of discomfort.

379
00:25:43,618 --> 00:25:45,024
I wanna see it.

380
00:26:03,899 --> 00:26:05,351
Give me a minute?

381
00:26:08,537 --> 00:26:10,727
Yeah, take your time.

382
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:08,024
Hey.

383
00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:10,038
What are you doing?

384
00:27:10,163 --> 00:27:12,116
You're not gonna tell
my parents, are you?

385
00:27:14,408 --> 00:27:16,304
If you get caught, I was never here.

386
00:27:17,182 --> 00:27:18,784
- Deal.
- Okay.

387
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,055
You want some?

388
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,901
- Don't push it.
- All right.

389
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:24,929
Hey, I was looking for the screwdriver.

390
00:27:24,955 --> 00:27:28,010
My mom always kept a junk
drawer in the kitchen.

391
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,525
Yeah. My dad gets fidgety
when he's nervous,

392
00:27:31,557 --> 00:27:33,682
so he probably just moved stuff around.

393
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:38,195
- Okay.
- God, no.

394
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:39,241
- No.
- I'm sorry.

395
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:41,867
With my mom being gone, he
probably didn't even realize.

396
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:44,258
No, it's fine. It's just a junk drawer.

397
00:27:44,284 --> 00:27:45,456
I'm sorry.

398
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:48,208
It's not a big deal, seriously.

399
00:27:49,713 --> 00:27:51,851
I'm gonna go check the dining room.

400
00:27:51,877 --> 00:27:54,815
You just keep that under wraps.

401
00:27:55,268 --> 00:27:56,315
'Kay?

402
00:27:56,949 --> 00:27:58,057
Okay.

403
00:27:59,483 --> 00:28:00,759
Oh God.

404
00:28:37,576 --> 00:28:38,998
How much further?

405
00:28:40,448 --> 00:28:41,783
This way.

406
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:57,118
No, he...

407
00:28:58,554 --> 00:29:00,531
He should be here.

408
00:29:00,735 --> 00:29:02,610
This is where I saw him.

409
00:29:06,516 --> 00:29:08,705
This whole chamber was full.

410
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:12,301
- Now it's not.
- Maybe we took a wrong turn.

411
00:29:12,327 --> 00:29:13,430
No.

412
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:16,274
Jasper, he was sitting right here.

413
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,866
There was a clock

414
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,093
and a wheelchair.

415
00:29:21,243 --> 00:29:24,272
And the bad things, they were sleeping.

416
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:27,520
Hey, maybe we should go back.

417
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,389
- You can get your bearings.
- I know where I am.

418
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,336
We need to go deeper.

419
00:29:33,382 --> 00:29:35,118
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

420
00:29:35,144 --> 00:29:37,374
- We can't leave without Jasper.
- Victor.

421
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,100
It's important.

422
00:29:42,349 --> 00:29:43,827
We'll be okay.

423
00:29:50,065 --> 00:29:51,274
This way.

424
00:30:01,973 --> 00:30:03,183
She's coming.

425
00:30:05,996 --> 00:30:07,555
She just...

426
00:30:10,193 --> 00:30:12,199
She just needs a minute.

427
00:30:19,134 --> 00:30:20,294
Thanks.

428
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,385
Hey, smile.

429
00:30:25,509 --> 00:30:26,635
What?

430
00:30:28,314 --> 00:30:30,083
Me and Julie found this in the basement.

431
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:33,406
I figured we should put together a
little Colony House photo album.

432
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:35,584
Doesn't have to all be scary and bad.

433
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:36,737
Okay.

434
00:30:38,695 --> 00:30:41,469
I'm gonna put a collage on the wall,

435
00:30:41,495 --> 00:30:44,247
if you wanna check it out later.

436
00:30:57,296 --> 00:30:58,439
You ready?

437
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:04,345
I don't wanna say anything...

438
00:31:05,772 --> 00:31:06,978
to Kristi,

439
00:31:07,455 --> 00:31:09,368
not until we have to.

440
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,970
Okay.

441
00:31:12,548 --> 00:31:14,017
You're coming, right?

442
00:31:15,515 --> 00:31:17,072
Whatever you guys need.

443
00:31:20,217 --> 00:31:21,313
All right.

444
00:31:40,957 --> 00:31:42,120
Great.

445
00:31:43,353 --> 00:31:44,913
And then there were two.

446
00:31:44,977 --> 00:31:47,640
Oh, for fuck's sake!

447
00:31:51,927 --> 00:31:53,554
It's ironic, no?

448
00:31:53,866 --> 00:31:57,086
A drunk looking for answers in
a tree filled with bottles.

449
00:32:00,984 --> 00:32:03,505
Why are you wiping that glass?

450
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:05,843
A man does what a man does.

451
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:13,193
So, you really think this
is gonna tell you anything?

452
00:32:13,718 --> 00:32:15,966
I think this place has a design.

453
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:19,044
I don't think anything's
here by accident.

454
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:24,317
Maybe that's your problem.

455
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:29,431
And what, dead Tom, does that mean?

456
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:32,063
Well...

457
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,021
nature has a design, Jade,

458
00:32:35,248 --> 00:32:37,917
and that is not nature.

459
00:32:38,778 --> 00:32:41,047
It's just something somebody put there.

460
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:43,664
Sure, it might mean something, yeah.

461
00:32:44,384 --> 00:32:46,153
Maybe it's something someone made

462
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:48,723
because they thought it meant something.

463
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,478
Maybe it's someone like you..

464
00:32:56,322 --> 00:32:59,275
Just looking for answers,
trying to figure things out.

465
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:01,579
Grasping at straws.

466
00:33:02,255 --> 00:33:04,941
And here you are, standing,
looking at this bottle tree,

467
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:06,295
puzzling over it

468
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:07,995
like it's a part of
the original design.

469
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:09,128
No.

470
00:33:11,986 --> 00:33:16,136
Miranda had visions of this place.

471
00:33:16,567 --> 00:33:18,283
She had visions of these trees.

472
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:19,831
You don't have visions

473
00:33:19,856 --> 00:33:21,887
about things that don't mean anything.

474
00:33:22,028 --> 00:33:23,715
What about the things you see?

475
00:33:23,864 --> 00:33:25,796
The Civil War soldiers.

476
00:33:26,162 --> 00:33:28,055
The guy crushed by the rock

477
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,234
- in the root cellar.
- No, no, no.

478
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,195
Listen, those were different. Okay?

479
00:33:31,462 --> 00:33:33,206
Those were completely different.

480
00:33:33,526 --> 00:33:34,854
How so, Jade?

481
00:33:34,988 --> 00:33:36,768
Fine! All right, fine!

482
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:40,492
Maybe it's garbage. Maybe this
is a giant waste of time.

483
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,437
Are you gonna help me
bring these down or what?

484
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,839
I gotta finish this first.

485
00:33:45,026 --> 00:33:46,596
For fuck's sake...

486
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:49,526
Jade. You mad?

487
00:33:49,552 --> 00:33:52,114
I am a little bit annoyed, yeah.

488
00:33:52,361 --> 00:33:53,697
You should work on that.

489
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:56,169
Because the Jade that built a
multi-million-dollar company

490
00:33:56,195 --> 00:33:57,839
when everyone said he shouldn't,

491
00:33:57,865 --> 00:33:59,963
that guy had thicker skin.

492
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:01,018
Yeah.

493
00:34:02,232 --> 00:34:04,135
You really wanna beat this place?

494
00:34:04,845 --> 00:34:06,752
Maybe you should sober up

495
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,986
and give that guy a call.

496
00:34:18,832 --> 00:34:21,776
There's a nicer way to
make your point, you know!

497
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,442
Hey, buddy.

498
00:34:34,996 --> 00:34:36,418
What ya got there?

499
00:34:37,563 --> 00:34:39,512
It's Tian Chen's.

500
00:34:46,943 --> 00:34:49,783
Did you learn to read
Chinese while I was gone?

501
00:34:50,161 --> 00:34:51,212
No.

502
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:55,486
Where's your sister?

503
00:34:57,643 --> 00:34:59,220
She went for a walk.

504
00:35:04,184 --> 00:35:06,686
Do you think Tian-Chen's
with her husband now?

505
00:35:08,758 --> 00:35:10,094
I hope so.

506
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:13,186
Do you think they were happy
when they got married?

507
00:35:19,303 --> 00:35:20,422
Honey...

508
00:35:21,888 --> 00:35:24,414
I'm so sorry you heard
us fight last night.

509
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,436
I'm so sorry.

510
00:35:28,258 --> 00:35:30,437
We're just trying to do our best...

511
00:35:31,521 --> 00:35:32,855
for all of us.

512
00:35:36,987 --> 00:35:39,468
I liked it better when
we first got here.

513
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:43,914
Everyone was so scared, there
was no time to be angry.

514
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,242
I wish it could be like that again.

515
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:55,371
What's Jade doing at the bar?

516
00:35:56,261 --> 00:35:58,544
That's what you guys were
fighting about, right?

517
00:35:59,896 --> 00:36:01,006
Jade...

518
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,685
he's trying to figure out a puzzle.

519
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,392
What kind of puzzle?

520
00:36:10,308 --> 00:36:11,646
Is someone upstairs?

521
00:36:11,845 --> 00:36:13,005
No.

522
00:36:15,648 --> 00:36:16,749
Are you sure?

523
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:18,068
What's wrong?

524
00:36:19,897 --> 00:36:20,997
Wait.

525
00:36:45,396 --> 00:36:47,096
- Anghkooey.
- Oh my God.

526
00:36:47,615 --> 00:36:50,041
- Why are you here?
- Anghkooey.

527
00:36:50,066 --> 00:36:51,918
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Anghkooey.

528
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,253
- Oh my God.
- Anghkooey.

529
00:36:53,455 --> 00:36:55,307
- I tried to help you.
- Anghkooey.

530
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,964
I tried to help you. Leave us alone.

531
00:36:57,997 --> 00:37:00,008
- Anghkooey.
- Oh, my God.

532
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:01,636
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Anghkooey.

533
00:37:01,661 --> 00:37:03,388
- Anghkooey.
- Anghkooey.

534
00:37:03,413 --> 00:37:04,914
- Mom?
- Anghkooey.

535
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,402
Mom?! Anghkooey!

536
00:37:06,428 --> 00:37:08,410
- Mom!
- What?

537
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:09,853
Are you okay?

538
00:37:10,522 --> 00:37:13,089
What? We're okay.

539
00:37:13,115 --> 00:37:15,756
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

540
00:37:16,287 --> 00:37:17,861
Oh my God.

541
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,527
- We're okay. It's okay.
- Was it the children?

542
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:21,944
Yes.

543
00:37:22,092 --> 00:37:25,095
- Can we go outside?
- Yes. Let's go. Let's go.

544
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,744
It's really nice of you
to do this for him.

545
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:40,670
Would've hated it.

546
00:37:40,944 --> 00:37:43,627
"Great. A pile a rocks? That all I get?"

547
00:37:44,993 --> 00:37:46,306
Well...

548
00:37:47,957 --> 00:37:49,759
it's not just rocks.

549
00:37:50,537 --> 00:37:51,931
It's dignity.

550
00:37:52,086 --> 00:37:53,879
Everyone deserves that.

551
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,675
Yes, they do.

552
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:07,814
You don't have to be here, honey.

553
00:38:08,259 --> 00:38:10,366
You've already been
through enough of this.

554
00:38:10,392 --> 00:38:12,267
Actually, I was...

555
00:38:12,525 --> 00:38:15,918
kinda wondering if you maybe had
some extra space up at Colony House.

556
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:17,493
For me.

557
00:38:22,746 --> 00:38:25,836
She was the only thing that ever
made that house feel like a home.

558
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:28,657
It was meant for a family.
She'd want them to have it.

559
00:38:33,182 --> 00:38:35,275
We always have room for you.

560
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:41,517
You're not still throwing those sex
parties up there, are you? 'Cause I...

561
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:44,186
Oh, just go pack your stuff

562
00:38:44,212 --> 00:38:46,095
before I change my mind.

563
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:47,978
Yes, ma'am.

564
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,688
There we go.

565
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,110
Can we come in?

566
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:08,931
I'm a little busy.

567
00:39:09,353 --> 00:39:12,634
Well, I told Ethan we can
help you with your puzzle.

568
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:17,454
Sure. Yeah.

569
00:39:19,454 --> 00:39:20,910
You like puzzles, buddy?

570
00:39:20,936 --> 00:39:22,025
Yeah.

571
00:39:22,642 --> 00:39:26,353
Well, great, 'cause this one just
got a whole lot more interesting.

572
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:27,991
How?

573
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:32,736
Turns out there is a second bottle tree.

574
00:39:33,856 --> 00:39:35,196
There's two of them?

575
00:39:35,314 --> 00:39:38,202
Not only that, but the messages
in the bottles, the numbers,

576
00:39:38,228 --> 00:39:39,548
they're all the same.

577
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:42,022
I mean, the placement's
obviously different,

578
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:44,556
and in the second tree, they're
written out in cursive.

579
00:39:44,964 --> 00:39:47,040
But the actual numbers,

580
00:39:47,704 --> 00:39:50,670
you line them up side by side;
they are exactly the same.

581
00:39:50,703 --> 00:39:53,603
Not to mention some of them
repeat, over and over again.

582
00:39:53,814 --> 00:39:55,337
What does that mean?

583
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,251
I have no idea.

584
00:39:59,526 --> 00:40:03,463
But I am increasingly optimistic
that, somewhere in here,

585
00:40:03,743 --> 00:40:07,361
somewhere in these dates,
in these numbers, is a key

586
00:40:07,852 --> 00:40:10,282
to something that we need to understand.

587
00:40:11,249 --> 00:40:12,704
You wanna help me find it?

588
00:40:13,364 --> 00:40:14,486
Okay.

589
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,882
You need to apply this every
time you change the bandages.

590
00:40:26,248 --> 00:40:27,622
I heard you the first time.

591
00:40:28,232 --> 00:40:29,810
That gets infected,

592
00:40:29,836 --> 00:40:32,779
- you're gonna be in a world of...
- I said I heard you.

593
00:40:35,721 --> 00:40:36,855
Okay.

594
00:40:38,663 --> 00:40:40,248
You're all set, then.

595
00:40:42,382 --> 00:40:44,441
Why are you pretending you're okay?

596
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:48,290
If you're talking about
Nicky, that was...

597
00:40:48,316 --> 00:40:50,193
No, you know what I'm talking about.

598
00:40:57,063 --> 00:40:59,274
Just make sure you change the bandages.

599
00:41:01,651 --> 00:41:03,587
You can pretend all you want,

600
00:41:04,067 --> 00:41:05,422
but you were there,

601
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,687
same as me.

602
00:41:12,111 --> 00:41:13,659
What if it's not over?

603
00:41:17,874 --> 00:41:21,186
Whatever happened to us, it wasn't...

604
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:22,432
What?

605
00:41:23,168 --> 00:41:24,400
It wasn't real?

606
00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:28,854
What the fuck is "real" anymore?

607
00:41:32,776 --> 00:41:35,549
It's gotta be easy for you in a
place like this, though, huh?

608
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,746
Going to sleep next to
somebody every night.

609
00:41:38,903 --> 00:41:41,323
You get to pretend that you're okay.

610
00:41:43,191 --> 00:41:45,760
Yeah, well, it's not like
that out on the bus.

611
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:47,883
I don't get to pretend.

612
00:41:48,668 --> 00:41:49,908
It's fucking...

613
00:41:50,962 --> 00:41:52,346
terrifying.

614
00:42:05,621 --> 00:42:08,020
So, then, don't go back to the bus.

615
00:42:09,647 --> 00:42:10,941
We got room.

616
00:42:11,377 --> 00:42:12,645
Go get your stuff.

617
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:15,301
You serious?

618
00:42:15,622 --> 00:42:16,684
Yeah.

619
00:42:17,628 --> 00:42:19,389
No one here has to be alone.

620
00:42:20,025 --> 00:42:21,684
I'll talk to Kristi.

621
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,096
Okay.

622
00:43:09,391 --> 00:43:12,478
How many of those little
green men do you have?

623
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,265
We'll be fine.

624
00:43:24,848 --> 00:43:26,639
- Careful.
- All right.

625
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:34,193
Victor, I think we should turn around.

626
00:43:34,232 --> 00:43:35,951
It won't be much further.

627
00:43:36,834 --> 00:43:38,888
You don't know that.

628
00:43:39,141 --> 00:43:41,602
If we get lost down here...

629
00:43:44,236 --> 00:43:45,713
We won't get lost.

630
00:43:46,896 --> 00:43:48,920
- Careful.
- Hey, hey, look.

631
00:43:48,982 --> 00:43:50,738
- We can come back.
- No.

632
00:43:50,764 --> 00:43:52,920
- Figure out a plan.
- No!

633
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:54,881
Victor, please...

634
00:43:54,907 --> 00:43:56,685
- Wait, wait.
- What?

635
00:43:57,049 --> 00:43:58,428
Look, look, look.

636
00:44:03,704 --> 00:44:05,179
We have to go through.

637
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:06,707
No, Victor.

638
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:53,971
No. Wait, wait.

639
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,798
Okay.

640
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,137
Let's go. Let's go.

641
00:45:05,163 --> 00:45:06,431
Oh, God.

642
00:45:06,457 --> 00:45:08,915
This is... it's your mother's.

643
00:45:13,454 --> 00:45:15,009
Oh, God.

644
00:45:15,204 --> 00:45:16,464
We have to go.

645
00:45:16,489 --> 00:45:19,509
You know, Victor, if you
keep coming down here,

646
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:22,876
one of these days, we'll make you stay.

647
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:28,280
Go!

648
00:45:28,446 --> 00:45:29,951
Go, go, go!

649
00:45:30,273 --> 00:45:31,728
Go! Come on!

650
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,666
You movin' out?

651
00:45:50,009 --> 00:45:51,134
Yeah.

652
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,377
Found a sweet little condo up the road.

653
00:45:55,403 --> 00:45:56,504
Yeah?

654
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:59,549
Yeah. Ocean views. Indoor gym.

655
00:46:00,275 --> 00:46:01,626
Sounds nice.

656
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,330
Yeah.

657
00:46:06,002 --> 00:46:07,416
Where are you really going?

658
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:10,853
Marielle said I could
stay at the clinic.

659
00:46:13,207 --> 00:46:14,470
How's she doing?

660
00:46:15,542 --> 00:46:17,674
She's acting like nothing ever happened.

661
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:20,728
How are you doing?

662
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:24,025
Get stoned a lot.

663
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:25,877
It helps.

664
00:46:27,511 --> 00:46:29,063
You got anything on you now?

665
00:46:37,098 --> 00:46:38,106
Okay.

666
00:46:39,262 --> 00:46:40,554
Come inside.

667
00:46:41,489 --> 00:46:42,770
Careful.

668
00:46:43,731 --> 00:46:45,910
Be careful. Come on.

669
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:47,972
Sit here.

670
00:46:48,582 --> 00:46:49,801
Okay.

671
00:46:52,778 --> 00:46:55,838
That thing, its voice...

672
00:46:55,864 --> 00:46:58,149
It's okay. We're safe now.

673
00:46:58,174 --> 00:47:01,652
Why did they have this?
It's your mother's.

674
00:47:01,677 --> 00:47:04,700
I don't know. They like to take things.

675
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,098
Why?

676
00:47:08,021 --> 00:47:09,840
I don't know. They just do.

677
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:19,216
What is this place?

678
00:47:19,591 --> 00:47:20,677
It's...

679
00:47:21,137 --> 00:47:23,162
just somewhere...

680
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,966
somewhere I come when it
gets too loud sometimes.

681
00:47:28,453 --> 00:47:30,496
I used to hide here...

682
00:47:31,943 --> 00:47:33,871
before the people came.

683
00:47:34,816 --> 00:47:38,802
At night? You would hide in here?

684
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:45,324
Because you were alone.

685
00:47:46,477 --> 00:47:47,870
My God.

686
00:47:47,896 --> 00:47:49,581
- It's okay.
- My God.

687
00:47:49,607 --> 00:47:52,034
No, everything is okay now.

688
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,959
Look, we found Jasper.

689
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:56,857
That means that we can save people.

690
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,302
How?

691
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:01,974
He knows things.

692
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,090
Yeah.

693
00:48:17,396 --> 00:48:20,781
I heard him tell Christopher a
story about this place once,

694
00:48:20,807 --> 00:48:23,209
and we have to make him tell it again.

695
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,433
But Victor...

696
00:48:27,841 --> 00:48:29,107
Victor...

697
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:33,560
that's a toy.

698
00:48:34,304 --> 00:48:36,232
We'll make him tell it again.

699
00:48:37,903 --> 00:48:39,146
You'll see.

700
00:48:41,743 --> 00:48:43,328
Okay. Let's lift this up.

701
00:48:44,576 --> 00:48:47,740
- I got the gel.
- Oh, great. Thank you.

702
00:48:48,687 --> 00:48:51,052
All right, so, it's just
gonna be a bit cold.

703
00:48:52,371 --> 00:48:54,386
Now, keep in mind,
it's still early days,

704
00:48:54,412 --> 00:48:56,276
so it's not gonna look like much yet.

705
00:48:56,302 --> 00:48:58,472
It'll be about the size of an acorn,

706
00:48:58,498 --> 00:49:00,964
and if we're lucky, we might
see the arms and legs.

707
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:04,216
So, just, keep your
expectations in check, okay?

708
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,544
Okay.

709
00:49:06,384 --> 00:49:07,468
Ready?

710
00:49:09,056 --> 00:49:10,129
Okay.

711
00:49:22,513 --> 00:49:25,649
Okay, so, there's your uterus.

712
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:35,578
What's going on?

713
00:49:36,366 --> 00:49:37,523
I...

714
00:49:41,038 --> 00:49:42,915
I don't see anything.

715
00:49:44,685 --> 00:49:46,361
What do you mean?

716
00:49:52,598 --> 00:49:54,033
You're not pregnant.

717
00:49:58,288 --> 00:49:59,379
No.

718
00:49:59,514 --> 00:50:01,998
No, that's impossible.

719
00:50:02,631 --> 00:50:04,352
I need you to keep looking.

720
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:06,587
- Fatima...
- You barely looked!

721
00:50:06,842 --> 00:50:08,363
Just keep looking!

722
00:50:08,389 --> 00:50:11,543
- Sweetie, I'm so sorry...
- I don't need you to be sorry!

723
00:50:11,569 --> 00:50:13,066
- I need you to look again.
- Hey, it's okay.

724
00:50:13,092 --> 00:50:14,504
- It's not okay!
- It's okay, just...

725
00:50:14,593 --> 00:50:16,971
Okay, we'll take a look together, okay?

726
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,608
- It's okay.
- All right.

727
00:50:22,794 --> 00:50:26,022
So right here is where the
baby's supposed to be.

728
00:50:26,805 --> 00:50:28,271
But there's nothing there.

729
00:50:30,052 --> 00:50:31,326
No, I...

730
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:34,645
There's something inside of me.

731
00:50:34,787 --> 00:50:36,683
I need you to find it.

732
00:50:36,709 --> 00:50:38,162
Fatima...

733
00:50:38,964 --> 00:50:40,741
there's nowhere else to look.

734
00:50:44,493 --> 00:50:46,116
We need to tell them.

735
00:50:47,305 --> 00:50:48,670
Tell us what?

736
00:51:17,467 --> 00:51:18,976
Help me, Elgin.

737
00:51:19,475 --> 00:51:20,988
I can save you.

738
00:51:21,014 --> 00:51:23,080
I can save all of you.

739
00:51:23,327 --> 00:51:25,666
I can help you go back home.

740
00:51:26,093 --> 00:51:27,311
Hey.

741
00:51:28,592 --> 00:51:29,926
Are you all right?

742
00:51:29,952 --> 00:51:31,202
You look weird.

743
00:51:31,836 --> 00:51:33,116
I'm fine.

744
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:36,428
I like the collage.

745
00:51:56,198 --> 00:51:58,872
The fact that some of
the numbers repeat,

746
00:51:59,398 --> 00:52:01,520
that means there's a pattern somewhere.

747
00:52:02,394 --> 00:52:04,403
The 2 on this one's backwards.

748
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:08,635
Same thing with the number seven,

749
00:52:08,661 --> 00:52:10,669
but they're only backwards sometimes.

750
00:52:11,028 --> 00:52:12,994
- Why?
- I don't know.

751
00:52:13,105 --> 00:52:14,825
That's why we have to
figure out the pattern.

752
00:52:14,851 --> 00:52:17,583
If we can figure out the pattern,
then we can figure out the shape.

753
00:52:18,475 --> 00:52:20,091
Get cracking.

754
00:52:24,937 --> 00:52:26,127
Look...

755
00:52:27,503 --> 00:52:29,939
whatever those kids are,
they're not gonna hurt you.

756
00:52:30,378 --> 00:52:31,924
How do you know that?

757
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:35,026
They want your help, right?

758
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,510
I don't know.

759
00:52:37,133 --> 00:52:38,377
Maybe.

760
00:52:39,237 --> 00:52:41,281
I'm basing that on
something a dead woman saw

761
00:52:41,307 --> 00:52:43,877
in a vision 40 years ago, so...

762
00:52:45,619 --> 00:52:46,891
I don't know.

763
00:52:57,031 --> 00:52:58,280
What is this?

764
00:52:58,672 --> 00:53:01,641
Some wards scattered
around the settlement.

765
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:04,469
I'm guessing they're protective.
They don't really seem...

766
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,797
What's wrong?

767
00:53:13,047 --> 00:53:14,965
Three red stones.

768
00:53:21,892 --> 00:53:23,023
What?

769
00:53:23,224 --> 00:53:24,860
Three red stones.

770
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:30,248
Did you see three red stones,

771
00:53:30,274 --> 00:53:32,438
big ones, in a circle?

772
00:53:33,309 --> 00:53:34,608
How did you...?

773
00:53:35,669 --> 00:53:36,743
No.

774
00:53:36,893 --> 00:53:38,281
No, no.

775
00:53:51,612 --> 00:53:53,464
When I was a little girl,

776
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,635
I would have the same nightmare

777
00:53:56,005 --> 00:53:58,073
over and over again.

778
00:54:01,968 --> 00:54:03,510
It wasn't just Miranda.

779
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:07,518
I saw this place too...

780
00:54:09,482 --> 00:54:11,229
but I just didn't know it.

781
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:28,005
