00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:28,509
Previously on From...

2
00:00:28,535 --> 00:00:31,470
Everybody here just talks about
how afraid they are of dying.

3
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:33,900
Well, I don't think that's the worst
thing that can happen to you here.

4
00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:35,469
When I blacked out in the ruins,

5
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,579
it was almost like I went somewhere.

6
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:39,040
And then I heard those children.

7
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:41,993
- They were screaming that word.
- Anghkooey.

8
00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:44,157
The bottle tree was
important to Miranda.

9
00:00:44,183 --> 00:00:45,813
She had visions of these trees.

10
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,962
Somewhere in these numbers is a key

11
00:00:47,988 --> 00:00:49,941
to something that we need to understand.

12
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,608
- There is no baby.
- Yes, there is.

13
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:54,212
It's just not yours.

14
00:00:54,376 --> 00:00:55,853
Elgin, please.

15
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:57,532
Fatima is missing.

16
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,892
What we're asking for is a search party.

17
00:00:59,918 --> 00:01:03,306
What if Fatima is out doing
something to help us?

18
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:05,361
I think she's gonna be okay.

19
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:10,337
The last place we saw her
was out at the shack,

20
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:11,672
which is about here.

21
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:14,267
So, we've got people
covering this whole area

22
00:01:14,293 --> 00:01:17,806
in and around town, which
leaves here, here.

23
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:19,415
What was she doing?

24
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:22,095
What?

25
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:23,915
Out at the shack.

26
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:25,345
Why was she out there?

27
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:27,697
Hey.

28
00:01:28,744 --> 00:01:30,298
I think Elgin knows.

29
00:01:33,063 --> 00:01:34,712
I think he knows where Fatima is.

30
00:02:38,646 --> 00:02:41,059
www.subtitulamos.tv

31
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:34,879
He said she was fine

32
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:37,621
and that this was all important.

33
00:04:37,647 --> 00:04:39,332
He was so calm about it.

34
00:04:39,472 --> 00:04:40,934
He said I shouldn't be afraid.

35
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,705
Look, I don't know if he just snapped

36
00:04:45,741 --> 00:04:47,639
or if something here is
actually talking to him.

37
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:49,893
Where is he now?

38
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,433
Colony House.

39
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,092
You two go up there.

40
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:56,162
And make sure he does not leave.

41
00:04:56,188 --> 00:04:59,326
- Okay. What are you gonna do?
- Just go.

42
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:05,037
Do you think they found Fatima yet?

43
00:05:05,902 --> 00:05:07,311
I sure hope so.

44
00:05:11,293 --> 00:05:12,428
Victor.

45
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:16,186
- What are you doing here?
- Your mom fell down.

46
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,607
What?

47
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:23,853
Thank you, honey.

48
00:05:25,111 --> 00:05:26,389
What happened?

49
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:29,338
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Yeah? Yeah?

50
00:05:29,364 --> 00:05:30,451
Yeah, yeah.

51
00:05:30,772 --> 00:05:32,694
I saw the Boy in White.

52
00:05:33,046 --> 00:05:34,139
Really?

53
00:05:34,527 --> 00:05:35,600
Yeah.

54
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:37,451
What did he say?

55
00:05:37,477 --> 00:05:39,354
He wasn't very helpful.

56
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:43,866
Let's go to the diner.

57
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:46,748
- I don't want to.
- Mom and Dad need to talk. Come on.

58
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:49,233
- Wanna come?
- No.

59
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,866
Come on. I'm hungry.

60
00:05:54,798 --> 00:05:57,217
The little girl, she led
us to the root cellar.

61
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:00,561
Victor was there.

62
00:06:00,881 --> 00:06:02,222
He was really upset.

63
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:03,811
He remembered something about his mother

64
00:06:03,837 --> 00:06:05,491
and the night she left.

65
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:08,060
When I hugged him...

66
00:06:10,673 --> 00:06:12,748
I felt like Miranda was there.

67
00:06:12,774 --> 00:06:13,920
What do you mean?

68
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:16,967
I don't know how to explain it,

69
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:19,529
but I could feel her.

70
00:06:20,152 --> 00:06:22,498
I could feel her in that room.

71
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:26,639
And then she took me back
to the night it happened,

72
00:06:26,817 --> 00:06:29,670
the night she left her children,

73
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:31,982
the night she went to the tree.

74
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:35,371
So you had, like, a vision?

75
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:36,967
No. No, no, no, no, no.

76
00:06:36,993 --> 00:06:39,412
It was not a vision.
It was more than that.

77
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,381
Somehow, Miranda was there,

78
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:47,147
and she was trying to tell me something.

79
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:53,544
We're closed!

80
00:06:56,654 --> 00:06:58,295
You're gonna wanna hear this.

81
00:07:00,662 --> 00:07:03,116
No offense, Jim, but I think
I've heard just about enough.

82
00:07:04,187 --> 00:07:05,600
Look, I'm...

83
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:09,514
I'm sorry about the way I
came in here yesterday.

84
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:11,135
I shouldn't have.

85
00:07:12,303 --> 00:07:13,534
I'm scared.

86
00:07:14,084 --> 00:07:15,600
Things are happening in my family

87
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:18,061
that I don't know how
to protect them from.

88
00:07:18,954 --> 00:07:21,069
But the truth is, I think you might.

89
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,017
I figured you might be here.

90
00:07:32,814 --> 00:07:35,072
I need you to come up to
Colony House with me.

91
00:07:35,783 --> 00:07:39,197
Elgin's been acting strange.

92
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:43,743
From what Ellis tells me, the kid's been
under a lot of stress,

93
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:46,111
plus he and Tillie were close.

94
00:07:46,484 --> 00:07:48,556
What happened to her may have just...

95
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:50,400
Yeah. I don't know. Anyway...

96
00:07:51,243 --> 00:07:54,517
he told Ellis that Fatima and the baby

97
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:57,376
are gonna be the reason
we all get to go home.

98
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:59,415
Now, that sound familiar?

99
00:08:00,822 --> 00:08:03,717
- What do you need me to do?
- I need you to talk to him.

100
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:07,111
Make him understand that if he
really is talking to something here,

101
00:08:07,137 --> 00:08:09,114
its intentions aren't good.

102
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,681
You of all people understand that, okay?

103
00:08:12,905 --> 00:08:14,415
Just remember...

104
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,775
Hey.

105
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:18,579
What the hell's going on?

106
00:08:18,605 --> 00:08:21,275
Ellis and Kenny are inside,
saying Elgin can't leave.

107
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,353
- Where's Acosta?
- She's still out looking.

108
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,743
I came back to see if
anyone found anything.

109
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,759
How many people you got inside?

110
00:08:27,785 --> 00:08:31,040
I don't know. A few. Most
people are still out searching.

111
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:35,025
I need you to clear the house.

112
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,696
When she got to the tree...

113
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,158
she was so close.

114
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,478
But one of these things
came from the woods and...

115
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:51,908
it smiled.

116
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:53,806
And you watched Miranda die.

117
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:57,400
You've had visions before, right?

118
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:00,197
Not like this.

119
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,877
It's always more like I'm seeing
something that shouldn't be there.

120
00:09:05,353 --> 00:09:08,273
Like, that day that I saw
the Civil War soldier,

121
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,931
it's not like I was
back in the Civil War.

122
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:13,040
This is... this is different.
You said something interesting.

123
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:16,368
You said that it felt like Miranda
was trying to tell you something.

124
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,455
- I know it sounds crazy.
- No, it doesn't.

125
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,626
Not here, anyway.

126
00:09:30,494 --> 00:09:31,556
Okay.

127
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,837
The first law of thermodynamics

128
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:41,430
is that energy can neither
be created nor destroyed.

129
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,947
It can only change from
one form to another.

130
00:09:44,973 --> 00:09:46,673
And our thoughts,

131
00:09:46,974 --> 00:09:48,829
our memories...

132
00:09:50,304 --> 00:09:51,614
our souls,

133
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,650
if you believe in that sort of thing,

134
00:09:53,712 --> 00:09:55,256
they're made of energy.

135
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:58,345
And that energy...

136
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:02,783
Maybe here, that energy,
I don't know, maybe...

137
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:04,564
it lingers.

138
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,438
All right, look, you
said it was one of those

139
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:10,189
creepy kids that led you
to the root cellar, right?

140
00:10:10,215 --> 00:10:12,126
- Yeah, a little girl.
- Okay.

141
00:10:12,152 --> 00:10:14,009
Whatever it was Miranda showed you,

142
00:10:14,035 --> 00:10:16,751
those kids wanted you to see.

143
00:10:16,978 --> 00:10:20,357
Where were you when you
saw the little girl?

144
00:10:23,584 --> 00:10:25,361
Out by Victor's truck.

145
00:10:37,197 --> 00:10:38,306
Elgin.

146
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:43,071
Mind if we talk to you for a minute?

147
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:44,822
Yeah.

148
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:46,229
Okay.

149
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:47,977
We'll go to my room.

150
00:10:49,571 --> 00:10:52,415
- I'll take that.
- Yeah.

151
00:10:56,996 --> 00:10:58,502
Just in there.

152
00:11:10,996 --> 00:11:13,239
Go on. Have a seat.

153
00:11:13,926 --> 00:11:15,082
Have a seat.

154
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,535
Can you watch the door for me?

155
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,762
I mean, it looks like you,

156
00:11:31,965 --> 00:11:34,332
packed supplies for a couple days.

157
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:37,926
Where were you going?

158
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:39,832
I was just...

159
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,559
Yeah.

160
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:46,621
I'm gonna ask you something,

161
00:11:47,178 --> 00:11:49,152
and I want you to tell me the truth.

162
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:52,075
Do you know where Fatima is?

163
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:56,762
- Elgin.
- Answer the question.

164
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,389
She told me not to say anything.
I just...

165
00:12:03,476 --> 00:12:06,973
I know how much you all care about her.

166
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,317
When you told me about your mom...

167
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:13,231
I can't even imagine what
you're going through.

168
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:18,657
I wanted to help. I don't
want to hurt anybody.

169
00:12:18,683 --> 00:12:20,230
But you have to understand,

170
00:12:20,672 --> 00:12:22,825
what's happening is a good thing.

171
00:12:23,884 --> 00:12:27,239
Elgin, you said she told
you not to say anything.

172
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,731
Who is she?

173
00:12:30,187 --> 00:12:31,552
I know it sounds crazy,

174
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:33,806
but I think she's an angel.

175
00:12:33,832 --> 00:12:36,137
- Elgin, there's...
- She's here to help us.

176
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,657
Something is happening
here that's beyond

177
00:12:38,683 --> 00:12:40,715
our ability to understand,

178
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,213
like in the Bible.

179
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,332
People never really understood then.

180
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,246
But they had faith,

181
00:12:48,231 --> 00:12:49,832
even when it was hard,

182
00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:52,473
especially when it's hard.

183
00:12:53,676 --> 00:12:56,832
Fatima's baby is going
to save all of us.

184
00:12:56,858 --> 00:12:59,926
Hey, Elgin, I need you
to listen to me, okay?

185
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:05,450
- There is no baby.
- That's not true.

186
00:13:05,476 --> 00:13:08,168
Kristi and Marielle did an
ultrasound in the clinic.

187
00:13:08,402 --> 00:13:10,137
And when they pulled up the image,

188
00:13:10,163 --> 00:13:11,692
there was nothing there.

189
00:13:12,614 --> 00:13:15,817
Whatever's growing inside
her is not a child.

190
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:19,608
The things it's done to her,
the things it's made her do...

191
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,652
You don't understand. She
explained all that to me.

192
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,794
Wait. The angel?

193
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,989
Yes.

194
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:29,668
Elgin.

195
00:13:32,175 --> 00:13:33,839
The day we met, I...

196
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:37,199
told you I killed my brother.

197
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,200
Do you know why that happened?

198
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,107
There were voices here

199
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:46,910
that told me if I killed a little boy,

200
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:48,827
we would all get to go home.

201
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:51,770
This place...

202
00:13:52,444 --> 00:13:54,129
it doesn't give.

203
00:13:54,646 --> 00:13:56,051
It takes.

204
00:13:56,942 --> 00:13:58,879
And what it's doing to you...

205
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:01,207
But do you see how it's different?

206
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,973
No one is dying here.

207
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:05,978
Fatima is gonna be fine.

208
00:14:06,004 --> 00:14:08,934
You don't fucking know that, okay?
You don't know that!

209
00:14:09,773 --> 00:14:11,324
Once the baby is born,

210
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:13,950
we all get to go home.

211
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:17,395
Elgin, even if she's pregnant,

212
00:14:17,512 --> 00:14:19,137
that's still months away.

213
00:14:19,163 --> 00:14:20,989
No. It's grown.

214
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:23,785
You should see Fatima's belly.

215
00:14:23,811 --> 00:14:25,470
- Okay. Where the fuck is she?
- No, no, no!

216
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:27,097
- Where the fuck is she?
- I can't!

217
00:14:27,123 --> 00:14:28,934
- Kenny!
- I can't tell you, Ellis!

218
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,317
- Kenny, Kenny!
- I'll fucking kill you!

219
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,090
- Where is she?
- I can't! I can't!

220
00:14:32,116 --> 00:14:34,468
All right! All right! Everybody out!

221
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:36,278
- Just relax!
- Out! Out! Outside!

222
00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:37,994
Everybody, now! Let's go!

223
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,517
No. He knows where she is, all right?

224
00:14:40,543 --> 00:14:42,504
- I can't just let him sit there!
- I know. I know. Just breathe.

225
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,848
No. I don't need to fucking breathe!

226
00:14:43,897 --> 00:14:46,848
- What I need is to find my wife!
- Listen to me. Listen to me.

227
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:48,989
We're gonna find out
everything that he knows.

228
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:50,700
I just need you to calm down.

229
00:14:50,726 --> 00:14:52,457
What he said about the baby,

230
00:14:52,483 --> 00:14:54,528
about how big Fatima's gotten,

231
00:14:55,114 --> 00:14:56,537
do you think it's true?

232
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,668
I don't know, Donna.

233
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:00,707
He's not gonna tell you!

234
00:15:01,993 --> 00:15:04,379
I know what it's like to have
this place in your head.

235
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:07,379
If he really believes what he's
saying is gonna save everyone,

236
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,121
he's not gonna tell you where she is.

237
00:15:13,772 --> 00:15:15,434
Where do you keep your tools?

238
00:15:16,254 --> 00:15:17,756
- Boyd.
- Where?

239
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:20,371
The shed.

240
00:15:20,722 --> 00:15:22,175
They're in the shed.

241
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:25,215
- Boyd.
- You stay by the door.

242
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,231
He doesn't come out.

243
00:15:28,738 --> 00:15:29,800
No one...

244
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:32,629
goes back in that room.

245
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:42,965
Victor.

246
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:48,702
How are things going with, Jasper?

247
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:52,489
Did he say anything interesting so far?

248
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,378
It's just a doll. You were right.

249
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:01,344
Dolls don't talk.

250
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:07,348
Look. I...

251
00:16:08,704 --> 00:16:11,082
I just wanted to say

252
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:14,981
I'm sorry I haven't been more help.

253
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:18,192
All this...

254
00:16:18,668 --> 00:16:20,540
it's been a lot for me.

255
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:22,465
But that's no excuse.

256
00:16:24,773 --> 00:16:27,410
- From now on...
- I have to show you something.

257
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,184
Okay.

258
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:33,843
It's gonna make you angry.

259
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,762
It's gonna make you hate me.

260
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,067
What?

261
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,668
But I have to show you.

262
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:41,950
And then we'll be done.

263
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:45,489
- Done with what?
- It's this way.

264
00:16:46,187 --> 00:16:47,957
Okay, okay, okay.

265
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:06,447
You really gonna do this?

266
00:17:10,227 --> 00:17:12,120
I don't got time for you today.

267
00:17:12,697 --> 00:17:14,100
What comes first?

268
00:17:14,126 --> 00:17:15,801
You gonna use the saw or the hammer?

269
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,791
Oh, you know what you should do?

270
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:19,721
You should go old school.

271
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:23,350
Get yourself some pliers and
rip his fingernails right off.

272
00:17:23,384 --> 00:17:25,150
Well, if that's what it takes.

273
00:17:25,352 --> 00:17:27,245
You really don't see the irony, do you?

274
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:29,072
What the fuck are you talking about?

275
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,761
Oh, I don't know. When
Fatima killed Tillie,

276
00:17:31,787 --> 00:17:33,385
you didn't even blink.

277
00:17:33,713 --> 00:17:35,596
I mean, you did everything
you could to protect her.

278
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:36,760
You took her out to the shed.

279
00:17:36,786 --> 00:17:39,247
You lied to the people
you claim to care about.

280
00:17:40,486 --> 00:17:43,291
Hell, Kenny's in there right now.
He still doesn't know what she did.

281
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:45,713
What happened wasn't her fault.

282
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,306
Okay, and tell me how that's
any different with Elgin.

283
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:53,642
I mean, this place got inside his head,

284
00:17:53,668 --> 00:17:55,728
made him think he was
doing something good.

285
00:17:55,898 --> 00:17:58,920
Convinced him he was
actually protecting Fatima.

286
00:17:58,946 --> 00:18:02,721
And now, you're out here getting
ready to go medieval on him.

287
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:05,679
Bit of a double standard,
don't you think?

288
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:06,994
It's different.

289
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,908
There's nothing I could do about Tillie.

290
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:11,377
Oh, bullshit. Tell yourself
anything you want, Boyd.

291
00:18:11,403 --> 00:18:13,923
I mean, you walk around here

292
00:18:13,949 --> 00:18:16,382
like you're some big
knight in shining armor,

293
00:18:16,408 --> 00:18:18,408
Mr. Noble Sheriff.

294
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:21,627
Push comes to shove, you're no
different than anyone else.

295
00:18:23,213 --> 00:18:25,898
You protect what's yours, and you
fuck anyone who gets in your way.

296
00:18:25,922 --> 00:18:29,471
- You were supposed to be better than this.
- You were supposed to be here!

297
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,252
You were...

298
00:18:31,864 --> 00:18:34,760
You and I were supposed to
figure this out together!

299
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:37,439
You were the one who went
in the fucking street

300
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:38,900
and got his throat slit!

301
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,857
So, don't you come in here and judge...

302
00:18:42,731 --> 00:18:44,189
You don't get to judge me.

303
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:46,619
I'm doing the best I can.

304
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:49,299
You know there's no coming
back from this, right?

305
00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:54,416
You said that you weren't gonna
let this place break you.

306
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,517
But if you do this,

307
00:18:59,025 --> 00:19:00,508
this place has won.

308
00:19:01,213 --> 00:19:02,561
And if I don't...

309
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:09,444
my daughter-in-law dies.

310
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:12,371
Well, that's why they call
it a rock and a hard place,

311
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:14,543
not a rock and a soft, comfy pillow.

312
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:19,986
You need to decide
right now who you are,

313
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:24,496
because that's who you're
gonna be from now on.

314
00:19:45,956 --> 00:19:48,468
Someone open this door!

315
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:50,281
Please!

316
00:20:50,293 --> 00:20:51,677
What are we doing here?

317
00:20:52,449 --> 00:20:55,488
I thought maybe there was a
reason they came out to you here.

318
00:20:56,246 --> 00:20:57,707
Look. The only thing tying together

319
00:20:57,733 --> 00:21:00,707
all the crazy that we've seen, right?

320
00:21:00,738 --> 00:21:03,676
Me, you, Miranda... The
one point of overlap

321
00:21:03,702 --> 00:21:05,846
in all our Venn diagrams of crazy...

322
00:21:05,872 --> 00:21:07,171
Is the children.

323
00:21:08,388 --> 00:21:09,863
Wait. You've seen them too?

324
00:21:09,982 --> 00:21:11,160
In the cavern.

325
00:21:11,581 --> 00:21:14,965
They were laying on these slabs
of rock, saying that word.

326
00:21:14,991 --> 00:21:16,418
- Anghkooey. Anghkooey.
- Yeah.

327
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:17,910
Over and over again.

328
00:21:18,962 --> 00:21:20,417
And I looked up.

329
00:21:20,772 --> 00:21:23,894
There was this hole in the ceiling.

330
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,355
And there was this mass of roots,

331
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:32,099
this tangle forming that fucking symbol.

332
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,558
The roots of the tree.

333
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:36,843
- What'd you say?
- The Boy in White.

334
00:21:36,918 --> 00:21:38,098
Victor heard him.

335
00:21:38,124 --> 00:21:41,262
He said when the kids
were on the stones,

336
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:43,613
they poured their hopes into the roots

337
00:21:43,817 --> 00:21:45,190
that made the symbol,

338
00:21:45,216 --> 00:21:47,723
and then those roots became the tree.

339
00:21:48,582 --> 00:21:50,613
Is it the bottle tree?

340
00:21:51,535 --> 00:21:53,418
Yeah, I think so.

341
00:21:54,026 --> 00:21:58,160
Okay. So the... creepy kids

342
00:21:58,797 --> 00:22:00,433
made a magic tree.

343
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:04,027
And the symbol that has been

344
00:22:05,332 --> 00:22:07,480
plaguing me this whole time...

345
00:22:14,989 --> 00:22:18,534
You could have just fucking told me!

346
00:22:20,098 --> 00:22:21,449
- You didn't have to...
- Jade. Jade.

347
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:23,445
No, no! I am sick...

348
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:26,161
I am sick and tired of
getting dicked around!

349
00:22:26,364 --> 00:22:28,926
If you really want our help,

350
00:22:29,254 --> 00:22:31,700
if there is something you
need us to understand,

351
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:34,036
you're gonna have to do a little better,

352
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:36,313
because we are not getting it!

353
00:22:36,428 --> 00:22:39,645
You hear me? Message is
not fucking received!

354
00:22:41,345 --> 00:22:44,786
So, we're gonna sit here,
and we're gonna wait.

355
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,575
And when you decide

356
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:50,246
that you have something more to say

357
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:52,559
than fucking Anghkooey,

358
00:22:54,157 --> 00:22:55,856
you know where to find us!

359
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:04,329
You feel better now?

360
00:23:04,355 --> 00:23:05,362
No.

361
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,948
Not really.

362
00:23:41,136 --> 00:23:43,075
You're not giving yourself time to heal.

363
00:23:43,101 --> 00:23:45,676
Fatima's still out there.
I can't just sit here.

364
00:23:45,702 --> 00:23:47,356
I'm gonna get some fresh gauze.

365
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:50,957
You were really quiet last night,

366
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:52,645
after they brought Julie in.

367
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:55,215
I just felt bad. I mean, she's...

368
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,739
Randall?

369
00:24:01,293 --> 00:24:02,981
Hey, what happened to your bandage?

370
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:04,168
It fell off.

371
00:24:04,754 --> 00:24:06,997
Where's the stuff from the
ambulance, the new stuff?

372
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:08,254
It's in the cabinets.

373
00:24:08,512 --> 00:24:11,364
No, not the medicine. The equipment.
Where did you put the equipment?

374
00:24:11,473 --> 00:24:13,211
There's a supply closet downstairs.

375
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:15,590
- Great.
- Randall.

376
00:24:53,632 --> 00:24:54,728
Stop!

377
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,723
I'm trying to make it fucking stop!

378
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,072
Look at me!

379
00:25:05,715 --> 00:25:07,884
Look at me. Hey.

380
00:25:09,852 --> 00:25:11,353
You're gonna be okay.

381
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:15,369
You're gonna be all right. Come here.

382
00:25:30,078 --> 00:25:31,593
No one comes upstairs.

383
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:34,531
- Dad, just...
- Nobody comes upstairs.

384
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:38,203
- You make sure of that, okay?
- Yeah.

385
00:25:40,977 --> 00:25:42,453
What happens next...

386
00:25:43,845 --> 00:25:45,351
that's on me.

387
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:55,415
Boyd.

388
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:57,688
Go downstairs now, Kenny.

389
00:25:58,579 --> 00:26:00,156
We should talk to him again.

390
00:26:01,547 --> 00:26:03,242
Look. He's a good kid,

391
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,123
and there's gotta be a way
to make him understand this.

392
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,602
Fatima's out there.

393
00:26:08,075 --> 00:26:09,898
She may be running out of time.

394
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,938
Go downstairs.

395
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,538
Please.

396
00:26:46,196 --> 00:26:47,656
I can't tell you.

397
00:26:48,477 --> 00:26:50,049
I wish I could, but...

398
00:26:50,711 --> 00:26:51,945
but I can't.

399
00:26:52,823 --> 00:26:53,949
I understand.

400
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:57,565
You need to do what you need to do.

401
00:26:58,111 --> 00:27:00,049
Now I need to do what I need to do.

402
00:27:23,663 --> 00:27:24,956
Motherfucker.

403
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:34,509
That's how she sends me messages.

404
00:27:35,674 --> 00:27:37,283
I think she wants to talk to you.

405
00:27:57,648 --> 00:27:58,903
Here.

406
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,403
Okay.

407
00:28:05,413 --> 00:28:07,223
Victor, where are we going?

408
00:28:07,568 --> 00:28:08,868
We're here.

409
00:28:09,303 --> 00:28:10,588
We're here?

410
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:25,617
What is that?

411
00:28:26,437 --> 00:28:28,320
I tried to make it pretty.

412
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:32,102
The way she would have liked it.

413
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,664
Wait.

414
00:28:35,785 --> 00:28:37,477
This is where I buried Mom.

415
00:28:38,876 --> 00:28:40,531
I thought you'd want to see.

416
00:28:47,554 --> 00:28:49,014
Oh, God.

417
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:02,415
Oh, God.

418
00:29:15,603 --> 00:29:16,728
Is that...

419
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:21,134
Is that Eloise?

420
00:29:21,853 --> 00:29:23,259
I think so.

421
00:29:27,052 --> 00:29:28,814
All I found were pieces.

422
00:29:32,802 --> 00:29:34,929
She was so small.

423
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:38,869
There wasn't much left.

424
00:29:43,189 --> 00:29:44,666
It was my fault.

425
00:29:45,821 --> 00:29:46,871
What?

426
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:49,384
I thought Jasper told
Christopher the secrets.

427
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,599
It wasn't Jasper. It
was the Boy in White.

428
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:54,226
I was wrong. He told
Christopher about...

429
00:29:54,462 --> 00:29:56,947
about the children and the tree.

430
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,978
But I was the one that told Mom.

431
00:30:04,689 --> 00:30:08,111
I told her that the tree would
bring her to the children.

432
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:10,986
I was the reason that she
left that night, Dad.

433
00:30:11,027 --> 00:30:12,986
I was the reason that she died.

434
00:30:13,084 --> 00:30:15,697
Victor, you know...

435
00:30:15,752 --> 00:30:17,666
If I'd just not said anything,

436
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:20,502
she would still be here, and
Eloise would still be here.

437
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:23,970
No. Victor, you were just a boy. You...

438
00:30:23,996 --> 00:30:25,916
I should have died that night, too.

439
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,049
What?

440
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,259
And you should pretend that I did.

441
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,189
You don't have to be my dad anymore.

442
00:30:31,215 --> 00:30:32,399
No. Wait. Stop.

443
00:30:32,425 --> 00:30:34,469
Goddamn it! I said stop!

444
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:40,009
You don't ever say that again!
Do you hear me?!

445
00:30:40,786 --> 00:30:42,103
You don't ever...

446
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:45,907
I'm your dad.

447
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:48,822
I will never stop being your dad.

448
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:53,119
Your mother did what she
did because she loved you.

449
00:30:54,126 --> 00:30:56,384
She was trying to protect you.

450
00:30:57,929 --> 00:30:59,447
That's my job now.

451
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,843
Okay?

452
00:31:02,337 --> 00:31:03,755
That's my job.

453
00:31:06,794 --> 00:31:08,056
Okay?

454
00:31:14,997 --> 00:31:16,684
Listen. If those kids made the tree,

455
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,356
then those messages in the
bottles, the numbers,

456
00:31:19,382 --> 00:31:20,880
they have to matter.

457
00:31:21,192 --> 00:31:23,364
How do we know the
numbers mean anything?

458
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:25,747
We don't even know who put them there.

459
00:31:26,113 --> 00:31:28,653
Think of all the people
who have been here.

460
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,997
We could be chasing
someone's random delusion.

461
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:34,208
No! Miranda knew those
bottles were important.

462
00:31:34,356 --> 00:31:37,083
Why else would she have a
replica in her backyard?

463
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:38,255
She's right.

464
00:31:38,281 --> 00:31:40,520
- There's something there. There has to be
something there. - Of course. There has to be.

465
00:31:40,546 --> 00:31:42,872
All right. Okay. There's
ten numbers, right?

466
00:31:43,062 --> 00:31:46,025
- Two are backwards?
- Yes, the two and the sevens.

467
00:31:46,051 --> 00:31:47,864
Great. So that means there's 12.

468
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,231
And believe me, I have tried

469
00:31:49,257 --> 00:31:52,700
every mathematical,
astronomical, astrological,

470
00:31:52,726 --> 00:31:56,153
Babylonian 12-point numerical
cipher I can imagine.

471
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:59,247
The Zodiac, months of the year,
fucking eggs in a carton.

472
00:31:59,273 --> 00:32:00,739
Bent over backwards twisting it

473
00:32:00,765 --> 00:32:02,437
into some version of the
Fibonacci sequence.

474
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:04,153
There's nothing there. Believe me.

475
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:05,919
Aren't there 12 notes in a scale?

476
00:32:09,865 --> 00:32:11,950
- What'd you say?
- Music.

477
00:32:12,262 --> 00:32:13,786
My mom was a piano teacher.

478
00:32:13,812 --> 00:32:16,583
She used to say that music
is the universal language.

479
00:32:16,676 --> 00:32:18,950
I mean, there are 12
notes in a scale, right?

480
00:32:18,976 --> 00:32:21,700
A through G with the
flats and the sharp.

481
00:32:21,726 --> 00:32:24,419
Tea Cup, you are a fucking genius.

482
00:32:24,445 --> 00:32:26,711
I love you. We need to get to the bar.

483
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:28,494
- You need to go to your house.
- Why?

484
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,133
Victor's mother had a violin.
He hid it somewhere in your basement.

485
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,583
- Why?
- Because I kept stealing it.

486
00:32:32,609 --> 00:32:35,122
Just meet us at the bar.
Come on, people! Let's go!

487
00:32:43,699 --> 00:32:45,162
How's he doing?

488
00:32:45,188 --> 00:32:47,148
I gave him something that
should help him sleep.

489
00:32:49,364 --> 00:32:51,341
What are we gonna do when he wakes up?

490
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:53,544
I mean, he tried to...

491
00:32:53,873 --> 00:32:55,841
He had the paddle on his head.

492
00:32:56,762 --> 00:32:57,857
I don't know.

493
00:33:00,373 --> 00:33:01,498
Look. I've...

494
00:33:02,255 --> 00:33:04,779
I've tried to be respectful,

495
00:33:04,805 --> 00:33:06,794
and I've tried to give you space,

496
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,755
but I just really need you
to talk to me right now.

497
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:12,364
About what?

498
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,162
Randall just tried to
lobotomize himself,

499
00:33:14,188 --> 00:33:17,177
Julie is a mess, and you're
acting like everything's fine.

500
00:33:18,734 --> 00:33:22,865
Hey. Look. I don't know what
the three of you went through,

501
00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:25,425
but I just need you to
tell me if you're okay.

502
00:33:25,451 --> 00:33:26,896
- Kristi.
- No.

503
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,169
Look at me.

504
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:30,255
Look at me.

505
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,474
Are you okay?

506
00:33:37,469 --> 00:33:38,748
No, I'm not.

507
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:45,208
And I don't think any
of us are gonna be.

508
00:33:47,411 --> 00:33:48,927
- Okay.
- Please,

509
00:33:49,302 --> 00:33:51,912
can you tell me what was in the picture?

510
00:33:53,154 --> 00:33:54,365
Boyd.

511
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:57,344
What was in the picture?

512
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,829
- That's what you wanna know, huh?
- Yes. Can you...

513
00:33:59,896 --> 00:34:01,076
Can you just...

514
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,248
Can you tell me what was in the picture?

515
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,583
You wanna know what was
in the picture, do you?

516
00:34:07,186 --> 00:34:09,474
You know what was in
the fucking picture?

517
00:34:09,888 --> 00:34:12,026
I'll tell you what was in the picture.

518
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:15,771
It was a picture of my house,

519
00:34:16,232 --> 00:34:19,333
the house that I bought with
my wife when I retired,

520
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:22,920
the one that we were going to

521
00:34:22,946 --> 00:34:26,216
when I ran into that fucking tree.

522
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,438
The only thing missing

523
00:34:29,565 --> 00:34:31,021
was the boat.

524
00:34:39,214 --> 00:34:40,906
Do you see what this means?

525
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:46,188
She's trying to show you.

526
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:48,727
We're going home.

527
00:34:50,178 --> 00:34:51,789
All you have to do is wait.

528
00:34:51,815 --> 00:34:52,946
No.

529
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,128
Boyd.

530
00:35:01,895 --> 00:35:04,839
Whatever it is you think you got
to do, you don't have to do it.

531
00:35:06,492 --> 00:35:09,058
I would never, ever hurt Fatima.

532
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,276
She's always been kind to me.

533
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,065
Everything I'm doing is for her.

534
00:35:19,474 --> 00:35:20,940
It's to help us.

535
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,120
If you just give it a
little more time...

536
00:35:25,146 --> 00:35:27,440
We don't have any fucking time!

537
00:35:30,074 --> 00:35:32,292
You took my family.

538
00:35:32,318 --> 00:35:33,729
Do you understand that?

539
00:35:34,036 --> 00:35:36,292
You took someone I love,

540
00:35:36,318 --> 00:35:38,211
and you put her in danger.

541
00:35:38,434 --> 00:35:40,453
I'm sorry about what happened to you.

542
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:43,378
But we're not gonna wait.
We are not gonna talk.

543
00:35:43,545 --> 00:35:47,503
You're gonna tell me where she is,

544
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,300
- or I am going to hurt you.
- I can't. I can't.

545
00:35:50,326 --> 00:35:51,920
And I'm not gonna stop hurting you

546
00:35:51,946 --> 00:35:54,722
until you tell me what I need to know.

547
00:35:55,158 --> 00:35:56,868
Tell me you understand.

548
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,041
- Tell me!
- I understand.

549
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:01,237
Good.

550
00:36:09,337 --> 00:36:10,589
Where is she?

551
00:36:15,808 --> 00:36:17,394
Put your hand on the table.

552
00:36:20,071 --> 00:36:21,224
I can't.

553
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,628
Put your hand on the table.

554
00:36:24,217 --> 00:36:25,615
No, please.

555
00:36:26,076 --> 00:36:28,373
- No. Boyd.
- We're playing, are we?

556
00:36:31,205 --> 00:36:33,774
Please, Boyd. Just wait.

557
00:36:33,808 --> 00:36:35,412
- Where is she?
- Just...

558
00:36:35,438 --> 00:36:37,873
- It's your last chance.
- I can't. Boyd, I can't.

559
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:39,318
I can't.

560
00:36:47,812 --> 00:36:49,404
Where is she?!

561
00:36:51,692 --> 00:36:53,021
I don't care!

562
00:36:55,483 --> 00:36:56,490
Hey.

563
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:58,819
Any news on Fatima?

564
00:37:00,459 --> 00:37:02,771
- What the fuck was that?
- Dani, listen...

565
00:37:03,271 --> 00:37:04,542
Hey! No, no, no!

566
00:37:04,568 --> 00:37:06,116
- Don't let her get up there!
- Dani, you don't understand!

567
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:07,636
Please, please, Boyd.

568
00:37:07,662 --> 00:37:09,578
Listen, I'm not playing with you!

569
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:11,334
Where is she?!

570
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:13,717
Jesus.

571
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:16,834
What the fuck are you doing?

572
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,271
Turn around and walk out the door!

573
00:37:19,297 --> 00:37:21,191
- Dani, come on.
- Don't fucking touch me!

574
00:37:21,217 --> 00:37:23,590
You do not understand
what is going on here!

575
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,529
Then explain it to me.

576
00:37:25,555 --> 00:37:27,935
- Everyone downstairs.
- What the...

577
00:37:29,657 --> 00:37:31,509
- Dad!
- Downstairs!

578
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,107
Let's go.

579
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,451
How do we know in what order they go in?

580
00:37:37,477 --> 00:37:38,576
Well...

581
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:42,342
we treat it like any composition.

582
00:37:42,368 --> 00:37:47,232
We try to figure out what is a
chord and what is a melody.

583
00:37:48,665 --> 00:37:51,556
2, 9, 7, 5. 2975.

584
00:37:51,582 --> 00:37:54,043
The 2 is backwards.

585
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,803
So, that would be a G

586
00:37:58,845 --> 00:38:01,034
instead of a B, okay.

587
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:05,396
Followed by F sharp, D, E. Okay.

588
00:38:05,531 --> 00:38:08,287
So, if it was a melody, it
would be something like...

589
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:12,122
? G, F sharp, E, D. ?

590
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,669
? G, G, another backwards two, G ?

591
00:38:15,695 --> 00:38:18,226
? G, D, C, C ?

592
00:38:30,863 --> 00:38:32,104
What's wrong?

593
00:38:39,327 --> 00:38:40,580
D, D...

594
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,481
Found it.

595
00:38:44,633 --> 00:38:46,588
- How are you guys coming along?
- No, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

596
00:39:06,422 --> 00:39:07,690
What is that?

597
00:39:09,267 --> 00:39:12,705
I don't know. I don't know. I've
never heard this before. I just...

598
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,604
I looked at the numbers.

599
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:20,440
I looked at the notes, and I just...

600
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:23,057
You just what?

601
00:39:24,257 --> 00:39:25,815
I could hear the music.

602
00:39:28,127 --> 00:39:29,401
All right.

603
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:32,737
Wait.

604
00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:34,204
Hey, stop.

605
00:39:34,503 --> 00:39:35,963
What?! What?!

606
00:39:37,384 --> 00:39:39,549
I'm not so sure this is a good idea.

607
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:43,416
What are you talking about?

608
00:39:44,025 --> 00:39:45,471
You cracked the code.

609
00:39:45,497 --> 00:39:48,729
Yeah, and the music just
magically popped into your head.

610
00:39:49,182 --> 00:39:51,174
Doesn't that strike you as odd?

611
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,510
Well...

612
00:39:53,354 --> 00:39:56,006
Everything about this place is odd.

613
00:39:56,032 --> 00:39:58,385
And this place is trying
to manipulate us,

614
00:39:58,456 --> 00:39:59,838
to hurt us.

615
00:39:59,916 --> 00:40:01,351
Oh, God. Jim.

616
00:40:01,377 --> 00:40:03,384
How is playing a song gonna hurt us?

617
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:05,440
Are you forgetting what Boyd said

618
00:40:05,466 --> 00:40:07,291
about the haunted music box

619
00:40:07,317 --> 00:40:08,776
and how it nearly killed everyone

620
00:40:08,802 --> 00:40:10,901
or the jukeboxes in the diner

621
00:40:10,927 --> 00:40:12,904
that just magically
turn on by themselves?

622
00:40:12,945 --> 00:40:15,151
All right. Okay. So, what are you
saying? We just ignore this?

623
00:40:15,177 --> 00:40:16,971
- We forget about it?
- No.

624
00:40:17,455 --> 00:40:18,824
We can't.

625
00:40:19,346 --> 00:40:21,916
Maybe we shouldn't play it here in town,

626
00:40:21,942 --> 00:40:23,924
just to be safe, just to make sure.

627
00:40:28,229 --> 00:40:30,416
I don't know if going out in the
woods is gonna do much good.

628
00:40:30,442 --> 00:40:33,720
I mean, what's the blast
radius on an evil song?

629
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,924
The message was left at the tree.

630
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,743
Maybe we should play it there.

631
00:41:11,477 --> 00:41:12,659
Stop!

632
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,551
No, no.

633
00:41:19,816 --> 00:41:21,597
No, no, no.

634
00:41:21,887 --> 00:41:22,973
No.

635
00:41:24,724 --> 00:41:26,151
It's coming.

636
00:41:42,748 --> 00:41:45,094
What if we forget what she was like?

637
00:41:46,614 --> 00:41:47,649
What?

638
00:41:48,064 --> 00:41:49,524
Tian-Chen.

639
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:52,649
I don't wanna forget what she was like.

640
00:41:52,675 --> 00:41:53,978
You won't.

641
00:41:54,475 --> 00:41:55,907
Why would you think that?

642
00:41:58,855 --> 00:42:01,767
Because I'm starting to
forget what Thomas was like.

643
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,243
I have to tell you something.

644
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,001
When we went to those ruins,

645
00:42:22,595 --> 00:42:24,564
when I walked inside, I...

646
00:42:26,382 --> 00:42:28,079
I didn't just have a dream.

647
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:30,501
I think I went somewhere.

648
00:42:31,579 --> 00:42:32,970
What do you mean?

649
00:42:33,004 --> 00:42:34,881
I don't know how, but I...

650
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:38,712
When we went to the ruins,

651
00:42:38,738 --> 00:42:40,699
suddenly I was in a chamber.

652
00:42:41,946 --> 00:42:45,782
And I saw me and Randall and
Marielle chained to the wall.

653
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:48,726
What were you doing?

654
00:42:48,752 --> 00:42:50,196
We were screaming.

655
00:42:50,788 --> 00:42:53,540
I think that's where we were
when we couldn't wake up.

656
00:42:56,915 --> 00:42:58,572
But then I left the chamber,

657
00:42:58,598 --> 00:43:00,158
and I went into the tunnels.

658
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,305
I heard Mom's voice.

659
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:04,016
And she was talking to Victor.

660
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:06,038
Remember how she said that Victor

661
00:43:06,064 --> 00:43:08,064
was the one who helped her find
her way out of the tunnels

662
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,734
that night when the house fell down?

663
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:11,485
I think that's what I heard,

664
00:43:11,511 --> 00:43:14,306
but I think I was actually there,

665
00:43:14,478 --> 00:43:15,501
like...

666
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,664
like I somehow went back to that night.

667
00:43:19,355 --> 00:43:21,196
You're a Storywalker.

668
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:22,892
What?

669
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,008
Someone who can visit

670
00:43:26,034 --> 00:43:28,532
chapters of the story
that already happened.

671
00:43:29,351 --> 00:43:30,548
What...

672
00:43:32,227 --> 00:43:34,227
So, I go back to those ruins,

673
00:43:34,731 --> 00:43:36,423
do you think I could do it again?

674
00:43:37,808 --> 00:43:38,954
Maybe.

675
00:43:39,539 --> 00:43:41,454
- Why?
- Well, if...

676
00:43:44,518 --> 00:43:45,899
this is real,

677
00:43:46,934 --> 00:43:48,962
that means I can change things.

678
00:43:50,052 --> 00:43:52,196
I can save Tian-Chen.

679
00:43:52,415 --> 00:43:54,241
Maybe I could even save Thomas.

680
00:43:54,267 --> 00:43:56,712
It doesn't work like that.

681
00:43:57,126 --> 00:43:59,884
- But you just said...
- You can visit the chapters.

682
00:44:00,276 --> 00:44:02,153
But you can't change them.

683
00:44:02,724 --> 00:44:03,837
Why?

684
00:44:03,863 --> 00:44:07,189
No one can change a story
once it's been told.

685
00:44:10,345 --> 00:44:12,071
It is not what it looks like.

686
00:44:12,097 --> 00:44:15,116
No? Because it looked like
you were torturing that kid.

687
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:18,579
- You're really okay with this?
- He knows where Fatima is.

688
00:44:18,605 --> 00:44:20,782
Look. I get that you wanna find her.
Okay? I do.

689
00:44:20,808 --> 00:44:23,202
But there is a right and
a wrong way to do this.

690
00:44:23,465 --> 00:44:24,797
Tell me the right way.

691
00:44:25,017 --> 00:44:27,904
You got all the answers! Tell
me the right way to do this!

692
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:31,355
I don't know, but maybe something that
doesn't involve torturing a scared kid.

693
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,061
Sara.

694
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:53,033
Hi, Elgin.

695
00:44:58,858 --> 00:45:02,327
I'd tell you if I could, but... I can't.

696
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:03,952
It's okay.

697
00:45:05,904 --> 00:45:07,218
I understand.

698
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,397
That first day,

699
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:11,640
when I saw you in the church,

700
00:45:14,292 --> 00:45:17,179
my heart broke for you.

701
00:45:18,124 --> 00:45:22,155
I thought, "He seems so sweet,

702
00:45:22,675 --> 00:45:24,051
so kind."

703
00:45:25,406 --> 00:45:27,178
I was like that once.

704
00:45:28,213 --> 00:45:29,499
I think...

705
00:45:31,169 --> 00:45:34,710
maybe we're exactly what
this place looks for.

706
00:45:35,752 --> 00:45:36,874
No.

707
00:45:36,993 --> 00:45:38,741
People who just want to help.

708
00:45:40,165 --> 00:45:44,671
Sara, can you please tell Boyd to stop?

709
00:45:45,311 --> 00:45:46,851
He'll listen to you.

710
00:45:48,022 --> 00:45:50,976
If we just wait a little longer...

711
00:45:51,002 --> 00:45:52,444
Then Fatima could die.

712
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,773
- No. She's not... Sara, no.
- Yes. Yes.

713
00:45:54,799 --> 00:45:56,593
I know you don't believe that.

714
00:45:56,619 --> 00:45:59,147
I know that you think that
you're saving everyone.

715
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,429
Sara, please.

716
00:46:10,805 --> 00:46:12,718
Boyd doesn't understand

717
00:46:13,112 --> 00:46:16,270
how far he needs to go
to make you tell him.

718
00:46:21,675 --> 00:46:22,758
Don't...

719
00:46:25,612 --> 00:46:27,309
He's a good man.

720
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:30,458
And this place,

721
00:46:30,934 --> 00:46:33,372
it's taken so much from him.

722
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,434
I won't let it take his soul.

723
00:46:40,573 --> 00:46:41,668
Sara.

724
00:46:42,528 --> 00:46:44,544
I've already given it mine.

725
00:46:44,817 --> 00:46:47,481
This is not Camden! I'm not
debating this with you!

726
00:46:47,507 --> 00:46:49,464
It's happening! You got a problem?

727
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:52,028
Take it up with me after Fatima is safe!

728
00:46:52,054 --> 00:46:53,895
Is this what you mean by trust?

729
00:46:55,223 --> 00:46:58,098
Okay. How's it gonna play when I go
and tell everyone what you're doing?

730
00:46:58,124 --> 00:46:59,458
Are you...

731
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:01,301
Shit.

732
00:47:01,327 --> 00:47:02,458
Go!

733
00:47:10,018 --> 00:47:11,184
Sara?

734
00:47:15,184 --> 00:47:16,840
Hey. Sara.

735
00:47:25,306 --> 00:47:26,614
Sara, what...

736
00:47:28,272 --> 00:47:29,997
She's in the root cellar.

737
00:47:32,535 --> 00:47:34,512
If anyone's having second thoughts,

738
00:47:35,048 --> 00:47:38,754
speak now or forever hold your peace.

739
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:43,614
Go ahead.

740
00:49:22,686 --> 00:49:23,735
Fatima!

741
00:49:25,904 --> 00:49:28,031
Hey. I'm here. I'm here.

742
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,024
She took it.

743
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:33,195
What?

744
00:49:34,553 --> 00:49:36,219
She took it.

745
00:49:36,521 --> 00:49:40,422
The thing, she took it down there.

746
00:49:40,672 --> 00:49:42,961
It's okay. It's okay.

747
00:49:42,987 --> 00:49:44,508
It's okay now.

748
00:49:44,534 --> 00:49:46,414
We're gonna get you out of here.

749
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,500
Dad?

750
00:49:49,526 --> 00:49:52,379
You and Kenny get her
back to Colony House.

751
00:49:52,594 --> 00:49:53,675
What?

752
00:49:53,701 --> 00:49:55,750
- I need to see it.
- Boyd, we...

753
00:49:55,776 --> 00:49:57,469
Look. Whatever this is,

754
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,391
I'm not gonna be blindsided
by this place again.

755
00:49:59,417 --> 00:50:01,611
- No. Dad, what are you... You can't...
- Look. Go.

756
00:50:01,637 --> 00:50:03,309
Take care of your wife.

757
00:50:04,608 --> 00:50:07,757
I'll be right behind you, okay?

758
00:50:47,346 --> 00:50:48,703
They're here.

759
00:50:50,188 --> 00:50:51,214
What?

760
00:50:52,177 --> 00:50:53,375
Where?

761
00:51:02,706 --> 00:51:04,211
Do you see them?

762
00:51:09,832 --> 00:51:11,844
Come on. Keep playing. Keep playing.

763
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,238
You're okay.

764
00:51:46,932 --> 00:51:50,277
No. Ellis, I saw them.

765
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:53,488
I saw what they did.

766
00:51:53,598 --> 00:51:54,618
What?

767
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:57,387
Those things that come out at night,

768
00:51:57,606 --> 00:51:59,399
I saw what they are.

769
00:52:01,396 --> 00:52:04,699
They sacrificed their... their children,

770
00:52:05,311 --> 00:52:09,574
because It promised them that
they would live forever.

771
00:53:48,611 --> 00:53:49,876
Anghkooey.

772
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:01,444
Remember.

773
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:06,906
- What's that?
- Anghkooey.

774
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:10,820
It means "remember."

775
00:54:15,346 --> 00:54:17,968
- We tried to save them...
- No.

776
00:54:18,203 --> 00:54:20,468
- because one of them...
- No, no, no, no.

777
00:54:21,145 --> 00:54:22,695
Oh, God.

778
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:28,139
No, no, no. I can't. I can't. I can't.

779
00:54:28,344 --> 00:54:29,617
What just happened?

780
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,961
We used to sing them lullabies.

781
00:54:47,697 --> 00:54:48,807
Tabitha.

782
00:54:48,961 --> 00:54:50,828
- No, I can't.
- Hey. Hey.

783
00:54:50,862 --> 00:54:52,697
- No, no, no, no, no. I can't.
- Tab...

784
00:54:54,963 --> 00:54:56,168
You can't?

785
00:54:58,051 --> 00:54:59,565
Please, talk to me.

786
00:54:59,812 --> 00:55:01,151
I know why.

787
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,299
I know why I see those children.

788
00:55:05,067 --> 00:55:08,338
- Okay.
- Why Jade can see them.

789
00:55:11,254 --> 00:55:13,510
It's why there's more than one bracelet.

790
00:55:14,802 --> 00:55:16,323
I kept making them.

791
00:55:18,149 --> 00:55:20,580
Somewhere deep down, I remember.

792
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,502
I don't know what the
fuck you're saying!

793
00:55:26,858 --> 00:55:28,432
I don't understand.

794
00:55:32,915 --> 00:55:35,034
It's because we've been here before,

795
00:55:35,725 --> 00:55:36,924
me and Jade.

796
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:41,354
The reason I felt what Miranda felt

797
00:55:42,576 --> 00:55:44,674
is because I was Miranda.

798
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:49,440
And Jade...

799
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,268
Jade was Christopher.

800
00:55:54,549 --> 00:55:56,682
We've come back over and over again

801
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:59,211
because we failed the first time.

802
00:56:00,182 --> 00:56:02,659
- The first time?
- Yes.

803
00:56:03,773 --> 00:56:06,260
Jade and I were here at the beginning.

804
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,245
We tried to save those
children and set them free...

805
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:17,534
because one of them was ours.

806
00:56:21,282 --> 00:56:23,034
She was our daughter.

807
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:24,662
No.

808
00:56:26,205 --> 00:56:27,612
No, that's...

809
00:56:27,797 --> 00:56:30,487
It's true. It's true. I feel it.

810
00:56:33,659 --> 00:56:35,416
And I need some time, honey.

811
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:38,705
Can you give me some time?

812
00:56:39,078 --> 00:56:40,541
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

813
00:56:54,857 --> 00:56:57,018
Sometimes I remember what it was like

814
00:56:57,044 --> 00:56:58,997
when it wasn't like this.

815
00:56:59,815 --> 00:57:01,497
What it was like before.

816
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:36,262
Dad! Can you hear me?!

817
00:57:36,288 --> 00:57:38,512
- Julie?!
- Dad!

818
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,914
I'm over here!

819
00:57:40,921 --> 00:57:42,262
Over here!

820
00:57:45,637 --> 00:57:48,730
Dad! Dad, you have to run! You
need to get to town right now!

821
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:50,699
- What's happened to you?
- You need to listen to me!

822
00:57:50,725 --> 00:57:53,347
It's not safe! I don't... I
think this is when it happens!

823
00:57:53,373 --> 00:57:55,684
- Okay. Slow down. We're okay.
- No, no. Listen to me.

824
00:57:55,777 --> 00:57:57,949
I need to change the story. Dad, please!

825
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:00,597
That was a hell of a song.

826
00:58:10,797 --> 00:58:13,495
That Jade sure can play.

827
00:58:16,597 --> 00:58:17,634
Get outta here.

828
00:58:17,659 --> 00:58:19,464
- No, you don't understand.
- Run. Run. Run.

829
00:58:21,075 --> 00:58:23,097
This didn't have to happen, you know.

830
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:24,315
Back up.

831
00:58:24,341 --> 00:58:26,573
Knowledge comes with a cost.

832
00:58:28,167 --> 00:58:31,112
- I said back the fuck up!
- Dad, please!

833
00:58:32,713 --> 00:58:33,800
Dad, please!

834
00:58:33,826 --> 00:58:35,401
I did try to warn you.

835
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,378
Get off him!

836
00:58:43,636 --> 00:58:45,026
Get off him!

837
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:51,627
Your wife shouldn't have
dug that hole, Jim.

838
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:58,136
No!
