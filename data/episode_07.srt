Previously on From...

3
00:00:10,445 --> 00:00:11,984
If these voices are real,

4
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:13,817
if something here is
communicating with you,

5
00:00:13,822 --> 00:00:15,251
then that means you're
connected to this place

6
00:00:15,255 --> 00:00:17,273
in a way that no one else here is.

7
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:18,901
But we need proof.

8
00:00:18,906 --> 00:00:19,976
What is this?

9
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:22,113
They said they watched
you bury the bag

10
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:24,820
and that this is proof
that they're real.

11
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,523
Do you know what that means?

12
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:27,930
Can I have my pillow back?

13
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:29,046
I just want to take a nap

14
00:00:29,051 --> 00:00:31,313
and it's sort of like a security
blanket for me, you know?

15
00:00:31,317 --> 00:00:34,103
Yeah, I totally get it. I'm sorry again.

16
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:37,351
You know, it's kinda funny.
I have a shirt just like that.

17
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:39,271
Oh, I know. I got this
out of your suitcase.

18
00:00:39,528 --> 00:00:40,984
What's wrong?

19
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:43,617
I think maybe I-I made a mistake.

20
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,780
I knew all about the divorce
and how this whole trip

21
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:48,048
was just one last hurrah

22
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:49,707
before you sat us
down to break the news.

23
00:00:49,712 --> 00:00:53,117
Thomas is dead! You have two other kids!

24
00:00:53,122 --> 00:00:54,820
Why aren't we enough for you?

25
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,009
What is that?

26
00:00:58,014 --> 00:00:59,494
A Farway Tree.

27
00:00:59,584 --> 00:01:00,759
Watch.

28
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:03,543
How does it do that?

29
00:01:03,548 --> 00:01:05,712
I don't know. But guess what.

30
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:08,111
- What?
- It works for people too.

31
00:01:08,116 --> 00:01:09,769
Really?

32
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:12,893
Problem is, you never
know where you'll end up.

33
00:01:12,898 --> 00:01:14,335
There's no wire in here.

34
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,489
- What?
- In the cord. And the plug?

35
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:21,559
Look. None of it makes any sense.

36
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:25,623
Mom!

37
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:27,195
Everything about this is impossible,

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,311
but we can find out
where those wires go.

39
00:01:36,927 --> 00:01:39,491
There was this weird fucking
symbol right on the ceiling!

40
00:01:39,496 --> 00:01:41,629
What are you looking for? Hmm?

41
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:50,888
I have this crazy idea that
might actually work, and...

42
00:01:50,893 --> 00:01:52,405
And if it does,

43
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,569
I might be able to find a
way to get these people home.

44
00:01:58,036 --> 00:02:00,365
They're so beautiful.

45
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,045
I'm so glad you like them.

46
00:02:05,662 --> 00:02:07,959
When can I come inside?

47
00:02:23,899 --> 00:02:26,452
What? Not acceptable. No way.

48
00:02:32,926 --> 00:02:35,276
Oh, let's not make a big deal.

49
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:40,981
It's a party, you guys, like...

50
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:46,175
- Okay, pick one.
- Um, this one.

51
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,623
I don't know, it just seems kinda weird

52
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,959
to be celebrating the day
that you got stuck here.

53
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,531
You're looking at this the wrong way.

54
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:56,451
It's about celebrating survival.

55
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,109
It reminds everybody that it's possible.

56
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:04,100
Besides, it's nice having a
little party once in a while.

57
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:08,510
Okay, what are you looking for?

58
00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:11,126
I am not looking. I am digging.

59
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,952
Aha! Here it is.

60
00:03:14,574 --> 00:03:16,530
It's my secret stash.

61
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:22,373
Trudy loves this sweater.

62
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,975
It's the one thing I own that I
don't let her get her hands on.

63
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:30,053
Besides, it is Ellis' favorite.

64
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:36,008
What?

65
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:38,207
Nothing. Uh...

66
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:42,047
You just... you make this
place seem almost normal.

67
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:44,035
You're really special.

68
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:46,791
Don't be silly.
We're all really special.

69
00:03:46,922 --> 00:03:49,067
Even Trudy.

70
00:03:49,072 --> 00:03:52,028
That's something a really
special person would say.

71
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,434
There's my girls.

72
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,457
Uh, anybody up for a little pregame?

73
00:04:00,462 --> 00:04:02,421
Baby, the party hasn't even started yet.

74
00:04:02,426 --> 00:04:06,039
I know! I know! That's
why they call it pregame.

75
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:09,105
What?

76
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:11,574
Nothing.

77
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:14,293
Just... go easy, okay?

78
00:04:14,298 --> 00:04:16,692
Yeah, I know. I know. I know.

79
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:18,949
Uh, Julie?

80
00:04:19,523 --> 00:04:23,867
- How 'bout you?
- Uh... I'm good, thanks.

81
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:25,632
Okay.

82
00:04:25,637 --> 00:04:27,742
Okay, whatever. You guys suck.

83
00:04:28,637 --> 00:04:31,374
Victor? Victor, where you at, man?

84
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:33,180
Let's get this party started!

85
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:34,970
Is he okay?

86
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:38,718
Nights like this are just
a little tough for him.

87
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:40,894
As much as you celebrate
the people who make it,

88
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:44,359
you also remember the ones who didn't.

89
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:49,726
Here, you should wear this.
It'll look really cute.

90
00:04:57,844 --> 00:04:59,106
Okay, come on, man.

91
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:01,304
I mean, you of all people
should be hammered today.

92
00:05:01,309 --> 00:05:03,081
I mean, how many years
have you been here for?

93
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:04,782
Please leave me alone.

94
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,898
- Oh...
- Ellis!

95
00:05:06,903 --> 00:05:07,904
Ellis!

96
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:11,485
You want a shot?

97
00:05:13,135 --> 00:05:14,367
Okay.

98
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,278
Donna, there's no more peaches.

99
00:05:20,593 --> 00:05:22,882
I know. We're, uh...

100
00:05:23,492 --> 00:05:24,889
We're all out.

101
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,578
They're gone?

102
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,852
I thought I had a few more cans
stashed away in the basement,

103
00:05:28,856 --> 00:05:30,499
but, uh...

104
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:33,046
I've been putting some
other things aside for you.

105
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:35,703
Some fruit cocktail. Some cranberries...

106
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,928
The peaches are gone.

107
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,015
All these years, that's...

108
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,162
That's the one thing
that's never changed,

109
00:05:42,632 --> 00:05:44,273
and now they're gone.

110
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:47,259
I'm sorry, Victor.

111
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,139
Yeah.

112
00:06:06,087 --> 00:06:08,687
Kevin, come on! It'll be dark soon.

113
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:10,103
Coming.

114
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,225
"There was so much joy on the faces"

115
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,059
"of all the new wondrous
friends she had made,"

116
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:47,429
"so much magic in all the
marvelous places she had been."

117
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:52,186
"Yet the Cromenockle had a feeling

118
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:54,441
"there was still more yet to come,

119
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:57,972
"and that her adventures
in this strange new world

120
00:08:57,977 --> 00:09:00,230
truly had just only begun."

121
00:09:36,758 --> 00:09:38,542
Jade?

122
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,670
I say you could come in?

123
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:45,655
My mom wants us to get dinner started.

124
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,988
Come on.

125
00:09:46,993 --> 00:09:49,735
- What are you doing?
- What the hell, man?

126
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:52,598
- I was reading this!
- There's no other paper here!

127
00:09:52,603 --> 00:09:54,910
That doesn't mean start
drawing in my fucking book.

128
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,219
You want me to write on your walls?

129
00:09:58,224 --> 00:09:59,747
Like a psychopath?!

130
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:14,715
What are you doing out here?

131
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:18,707
I, uh, think there's some
things we need to talk about.

132
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:20,762
In private.

133
00:10:21,398 --> 00:10:22,856
All right, come by in the morning.

134
00:10:22,861 --> 00:10:26,098
No. I think we should do this now.

135
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,367
It's important.

136
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:33,526
I guess we're having a sleepover then.

137
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:36,755
Come on in.

138
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:51,801
Looks like you're going somewhere.

139
00:10:51,806 --> 00:10:56,550
Yeah. I was gonna come by and
talk to you about all this.

140
00:10:56,894 --> 00:10:59,245
Well, we have more to
talk about than I thought.

141
00:11:05,224 --> 00:11:07,348
He's completely passed out.

142
00:11:07,915 --> 00:11:10,121
Well, pretty sure

143
00:11:10,126 --> 00:11:12,215
you violated about a
dozen child labor laws

144
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,879
by having him dig in
the basement all day.

145
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:17,981
No, he was having fun.
He just wanted to help.

146
00:11:21,495 --> 00:11:24,019
I get so nervous every
time I take my eyes off him.

147
00:11:24,024 --> 00:11:26,679
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

148
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:31,301
But, look, windows are nailed shut.

149
00:11:31,598 --> 00:11:34,059
The doors are locked.

150
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:36,429
He couldn't let one of
those things in if he tried.

151
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:38,770
Yeah, yeah.

152
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:43,410
Fuck! And then I think
about Julie up in that house.

153
00:11:43,415 --> 00:11:46,549
Donna, the lady who runs
the place, she might be a...

154
00:11:49,736 --> 00:11:51,956
But she's definitely not stupid.

155
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:52,961
Yeah.

156
00:11:53,856 --> 00:11:55,945
How's it going?

157
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:58,137
Well...

158
00:11:58,142 --> 00:11:59,956
provided I can convince the sheriff

159
00:11:59,961 --> 00:12:02,496
to let me use all of
their building materials,

160
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:05,243
not to mention drain every
single battery they've got,

161
00:12:05,248 --> 00:12:06,902
and get Donna to allow us to build

162
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:08,738
on the high ground at Colony House,

163
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:09,983
should be just promising enough

164
00:12:09,988 --> 00:12:12,077
for everyone to hate me when it fails.

165
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:14,337
Oh, come on, don't say that.

166
00:12:14,342 --> 00:12:15,909
You got a signal.

167
00:12:15,914 --> 00:12:18,134
No, come on. I got static.

168
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,306
That's a far cry from a signal.

169
00:12:20,311 --> 00:12:21,921
Well, but it's something.

170
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,377
Yeah.

171
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:29,999
Hey. Hey.

172
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:34,356
It matters.

173
00:12:35,369 --> 00:12:37,197
And look, look on the bright side,

174
00:12:37,202 --> 00:12:39,551
at least we've got our hole in
the basement to fall back on.

175
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:40,643
Or in.

176
00:12:40,648 --> 00:12:43,129
Or in. I'm gonna head back down.

177
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:46,671
Best get to it.

178
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:57,856
Oh, shit.

179
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,738
Hey, watch where
you're going, man. Fuck.

180
00:12:59,743 --> 00:13:02,254
Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Hold on.

181
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:03,869
- Hey.
- Maybe slow down a little bit.

182
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:05,736
Hey, I'm... I'm fine. I'm fine.

183
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:07,564
It's a party, right?

184
00:13:08,262 --> 00:13:09,595
Don't worry.

185
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:14,613
Is everything okay?

186
00:13:14,871 --> 00:13:16,621
Yeah, I think so.

187
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:18,793
He said not to worry,
so I'm going to worry.

188
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,824
All right, everybody settle down now!

189
00:13:22,312 --> 00:13:24,066
- Everybody!
- We should go.

190
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:25,449
Yeah, yeah, yes.

191
00:13:25,454 --> 00:13:29,066
Hey, shut your fucking mouths!

192
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:32,809
All right.

193
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:35,437
We are here tonight

194
00:13:35,442 --> 00:13:39,043
to celebrate a very special anniversary.

195
00:13:39,048 --> 00:13:40,310
Yeah.

196
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:42,418
One year ago today...

197
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:48,257
Our dear sweet Fatima
came into our lives.

198
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:51,053
Some of you were here then,

199
00:13:51,308 --> 00:13:53,935
many of you arrived since.

200
00:13:54,776 --> 00:13:58,301
But all of you have come to know her

201
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,274
and to love her,

202
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:04,035
for her kindness, for her strength,

203
00:14:04,454 --> 00:14:05,622
for her wisdom...

204
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,150
And for her weed!

205
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:13,499
The green thumb is
definitely a big plus.

206
00:14:14,815 --> 00:14:17,208
Our greenhouse never smelled so good.

207
00:14:19,263 --> 00:14:22,005
But, uh, seriously,

208
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:24,707
the truth is...

209
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:28,252
you've made this big old drafty box

210
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:30,309
feel a little bit more like home.

211
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:34,309
Happy anniversary, sweet pea.

212
00:14:35,034 --> 00:14:36,481
Donna...

213
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:41,211
Thank you.

214
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:51,455
This is so beautiful.

215
00:14:52,938 --> 00:14:55,879
May it catch all the bad dreams...

216
00:14:56,881 --> 00:14:59,536
And let only the sweet ones reach you.

217
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:04,176
- Come here.
- Thank you.

218
00:15:05,347 --> 00:15:09,176
Oh. We are so lucky to have you.

219
00:15:10,072 --> 00:15:12,285
So lucky to have...

220
00:15:13,254 --> 00:15:14,910
All right with the mushy.

221
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:18,137
All right, everybody,
you all know the protocol.

222
00:15:18,142 --> 00:15:21,741
Drink, smoke, have fun,

223
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:24,137
keep an eye on each other.

224
00:15:24,142 --> 00:15:26,285
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

225
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,791
Cheers, baby.

226
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,231
Happy anniversary, gorgeous.

227
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:35,277
Thank you.

228
00:15:45,213 --> 00:15:47,012
Look at what she got me.

229
00:15:48,204 --> 00:15:49,856
She made this herself.

230
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:51,824
Aw!

231
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:55,036
So, that's the plan. Yup.

232
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,956
Find a way outta here once and for all

233
00:15:56,961 --> 00:16:00,527
before it all comes
crashing down around us.

234
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:04,398
Your turn.

235
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,817
I buried this bag the day I arrived.

236
00:16:16,146 --> 00:16:17,713
Open it.

237
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,132
Holding out on me?

238
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:32,382
This yours?

239
00:16:34,873 --> 00:16:37,965
I'm not talking about the shirt.
I'm talking about the blood.

240
00:16:38,484 --> 00:16:40,434
There's another item in the bag.

241
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:47,748
I mean, what... what is it?
What the fuck is going on?

242
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,207
We've never really discussed
who we used to be...

243
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:57,629
before we came here.

244
00:17:07,553 --> 00:17:12,079
There was this young
boy in my congregation.

245
00:17:12,686 --> 00:17:16,504
He was quiet, sensitive.

246
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:19,910
He used to get so excited

247
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:22,684
when his mother let him put
a dollar in the collection plate.

248
00:17:26,196 --> 00:17:28,738
One day, after mass,

249
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:32,481
I found him lingering
outside the rectory

250
00:17:33,949 --> 00:17:35,532
and it was unusual.

251
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,794
You know, he wasn't
really the type of kid

252
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:40,150
to stray too far from his parents.

253
00:17:40,154 --> 00:17:41,942
They were very, um...

254
00:17:43,206 --> 00:17:45,121
strict...

255
00:17:47,447 --> 00:17:49,206
rigid.

256
00:17:50,622 --> 00:17:54,887
And I get it. Parents,
they worry about their kids,

257
00:17:54,892 --> 00:17:56,692
and sometimes you have...

258
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:03,020
I'm sorry. Do you mind?

259
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,949
Anyway, the point is...

260
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:19,372
the boy was upset.

261
00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:23,449
He asked if he could stay a while.

262
00:18:23,454 --> 00:18:26,762
But I had to prepare for evening mass

263
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:30,371
and I didn't want the parents to worry.

264
00:18:33,105 --> 00:18:35,301
So I, uh...

265
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,794
I went to my drawer and
I pulled out a candy bar.

266
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:44,979
I, uh... I always keep a stash
for the neighborhood kids.

267
00:18:47,774 --> 00:18:50,473
I could see he didn't want to go.

268
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:57,598
But I handed it to him
and I sent him on his way.

269
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:07,184
Later that evening, I,
uh... I went by the house.

270
00:19:10,187 --> 00:19:11,481
It was a bit unorthodox.

271
00:19:11,486 --> 00:19:15,142
You know, I'm not really in
the habit of making house calls,

272
00:19:15,658 --> 00:19:18,618
but something was
nagging me and I just...

273
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:22,655
As I walked up the driveway,

274
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,699
the mother, she came running out,

275
00:19:26,739 --> 00:19:28,637
hysterical...

276
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:31,293
inconsolable.

277
00:19:32,147 --> 00:19:33,932
She was...

278
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:39,395
And I could smell the alcohol

279
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,315
the moment I stepped through the door.

280
00:19:42,635 --> 00:19:44,770
The father was just...

281
00:19:45,443 --> 00:19:47,271
standing there with this panicked,

282
00:19:47,276 --> 00:19:49,278
dumbfounded look on his face.

283
00:19:49,744 --> 00:19:53,793
"Get up! Get up!" he said.

284
00:19:56,848 --> 00:20:02,512
I walked over and I stepped
in the room, and there he was.

285
00:20:04,217 --> 00:20:08,961
This sweet, innocent boy,

286
00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:12,481
just laying there, broken.

287
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:18,309
His neck was bulging
in a way... It was...

288
00:20:22,032 --> 00:20:25,137
And I could see, in his pocket...

289
00:20:26,456 --> 00:20:28,414
the candy bar.

290
00:20:33,923 --> 00:20:36,059
"He'll be fine."

291
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,341
That's what the father
said. "He'll be fine."

292
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,535
It was the way he said it.

293
00:20:43,514 --> 00:20:45,211
Sounded indignant.

294
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:51,301
The next thing I knew,
I was on top of him,

295
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,725
smashing his face as hard as I could.

296
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,067
I couldn't stop.

297
00:20:58,072 --> 00:21:01,075
I just kept hitting
him over and over again.

298
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,184
I couldn't stop.

299
00:21:02,189 --> 00:21:05,868
Even when I felt the bones
in my hand start to break,

300
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:06,873
I couldn't stop.

301
00:21:09,637 --> 00:21:13,510
I was the one who was
supposed to listen.

302
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,676
I was the one who was supposed
to defend the defenseless.

303
00:21:17,681 --> 00:21:21,918
That sweet little boy came
to me begging for help,

304
00:21:21,923 --> 00:21:24,684
and all I could do was
give him a candy bar.

305
00:21:25,655 --> 00:21:28,180
A fucking candy bar!

306
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:38,582
The next thing I remember,

307
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:42,001
I was standing on a bridge,
holding that bottle in my hand.

308
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,497
And it was the first time in my life

309
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:46,242
that I heard the voice of God.

310
00:21:48,162 --> 00:21:49,731
He told me to get back in the car,

311
00:21:49,736 --> 00:21:52,087
that there was another
path for me to follow.

312
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,223
So I did.

313
00:21:55,984 --> 00:21:57,508
I got back in the car and I drove,

314
00:21:57,513 --> 00:21:59,341
and two hours later, I was here.

315
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,701
Why are you telling me all this now?

316
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,238
Because I have Sara tied up
in the basement of the church.

317
00:22:14,498 --> 00:22:17,402
Look, I've always known that
there's a reason we're here,

318
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:18,763
that there's a path
we're meant to follow,

319
00:22:18,767 --> 00:22:21,008
and I know it may seem...

320
00:22:21,653 --> 00:22:23,525
Tell me you're joking.

321
00:22:24,365 --> 00:22:27,036
- Boyd...
- Tell me you are motherfucking joking!

322
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,128
Are you gonna shoot me?

323
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:29,482
I might fucking shoot you, yeah!

324
00:22:29,487 --> 00:22:32,253
You told me that Frank broke the rules.

325
00:22:32,258 --> 00:22:34,042
Frank had to go in the box!

326
00:22:34,047 --> 00:22:35,613
And now you just... That girl...

327
00:22:35,618 --> 00:22:37,873
That girl may be the key
to unlocking all this.

328
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:41,185
That girl...

329
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,627
may be the way we all go home.

330
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:47,066
Keep talking.

331
00:22:47,751 --> 00:22:49,013
Okay.

332
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,637
Jasmine.

333
00:23:08,395 --> 00:23:09,839
Jasmine!

334
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:11,564
What's wrong?

335
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:14,257
I only came to say goodbye.

336
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,433
What? Wait, wait, wait.

337
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:20,134
I don't understand.
Just please talk to me.

338
00:23:23,084 --> 00:23:24,825
Why won't you let me in?

339
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:34,815
You know why. I can't.

340
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,427
Please, just stay and talk with me.

341
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:39,853
You said you liked me.

342
00:23:39,858 --> 00:23:41,691
I do!

343
00:23:42,526 --> 00:23:44,553
I can't keep coming here,

344
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:47,774
knowing I'll see you but
never get to feel you,

345
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:50,308
knowing you're afraid of me,

346
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,568
that you're disgusted by me.

347
00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:54,089
No. It...

348
00:23:54,094 --> 00:23:56,839
You always tell me how
lonely you are in there.

349
00:23:56,897 --> 00:24:00,503
You have no idea how
lonely it is out here.

350
00:24:02,122 --> 00:24:04,603
It wasn't my choice to be this way.

351
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:07,517
Goodbye, Kevin.

352
00:24:07,522 --> 00:24:09,324
Wait, wait.

353
00:24:13,154 --> 00:24:16,488
You know, there's a
party going on downstairs.

354
00:24:16,901 --> 00:24:19,410
Everyone's having a really good time.

355
00:24:20,681 --> 00:24:22,857
But you are the only one
that I want to be with.

356
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:25,430
You are the only one
that I can really talk to.

357
00:24:31,228 --> 00:24:34,361
You promise it'll just be
you? No one else can get in?

358
00:24:35,036 --> 00:24:39,084
Not once we shut the window, I promise.

359
00:24:42,685 --> 00:24:44,035
Okay.

360
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:57,401
And now, the question is...

361
00:25:00,422 --> 00:25:02,903
How many dimensions are there?

362
00:25:02,908 --> 00:25:07,152
Bosonic string theorists
believe there are 26 dimensions,

363
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:10,456
but superstring theorists
say there's only 10.

364
00:25:10,461 --> 00:25:13,332
And is that what this place is?
Another dimension?

365
00:25:13,337 --> 00:25:14,495
Oh, no, no.

366
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,589
This is a pocket universe.

367
00:25:16,594 --> 00:25:18,152
Oh, my God.

368
00:25:19,332 --> 00:25:21,203
For Christ's sake, man, enough.

369
00:25:23,101 --> 00:25:24,667
It's not a pocket universe;

370
00:25:24,672 --> 00:25:26,062
it's not whatever the
fuck you think it is,

371
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,546
and nobody gives a fuck.

372
00:25:27,551 --> 00:25:30,597
So why don't you shut the fuck up, man?

373
00:25:30,602 --> 00:25:33,886
Yeah, okay, have another drink.

374
00:25:34,636 --> 00:25:36,636
All right, calm down.

375
00:25:38,365 --> 00:25:39,365
Jesus!

376
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,949
- Hey!
- What are you gonna do about it? Huh?

377
00:25:41,954 --> 00:25:43,855
- Hey! All right, okay.
- What are you gonna do?

378
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:47,089
Take him upstairs before he
starts shooting up the place.

379
00:25:50,881 --> 00:25:53,035
- No, no, no, no!
- Hey, hey, hey! That's enough.

380
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,230
That's enough! Now, ease up!

381
00:25:57,295 --> 00:25:59,036
You okay?

382
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,456
Hey, you okay?

383
00:26:04,175 --> 00:26:06,816
Yeah, I'm sorry. I, um...

384
00:26:08,797 --> 00:26:10,451
I'm just gonna go upstairs and lay down.

385
00:26:10,456 --> 00:26:11,718
Okay. I'll come with you.

386
00:26:11,723 --> 00:26:15,003
Nah, it's fine. It's
fine. Hey, I'm just, uh...

387
00:26:18,532 --> 00:26:20,480
It's your night.

388
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,463
Just stay.

389
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,919
Goddamn animal.

390
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:35,115
Like mother, like son.

391
00:26:39,812 --> 00:26:42,769
You stay the fuck outta my sight.

392
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:53,941
Now, close the window, quick.

393
00:27:00,949 --> 00:27:04,735
See? Just the two of us.

394
00:27:05,258 --> 00:27:06,999
Just the two of us.

395
00:27:10,293 --> 00:27:12,208
My handsome boy.

396
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,935
Your hands are so warm.

397
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:17,113
Did you think they would be cold?

398
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:21,674
Kiss me.

399
00:28:00,161 --> 00:28:01,205
What?

400
00:28:03,546 --> 00:28:05,287
Dinner's ready.

401
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:06,878
I'm not hungry.

402
00:28:07,724 --> 00:28:08,746
You've been staring at that book

403
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,254
for a day and a half,
maybe you should...

404
00:28:10,258 --> 00:28:13,382
- Just fuck off. Just fuck off.
- You know what, Jade?

405
00:28:16,956 --> 00:28:18,343
Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay!

406
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:19,988
I'm coming! Jesus!

407
00:28:21,176 --> 00:28:24,745
Uh, I wouldn't take
too long if I were you.

408
00:28:38,905 --> 00:28:41,816
You know, you should really
work on your party face.

409
00:28:42,718 --> 00:28:44,894
What are you doing, sitting
here all by yourself?

410
00:28:46,941 --> 00:28:48,863
You don't have to.

411
00:28:49,945 --> 00:28:51,581
I know you don't like me.

412
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:54,636
That's not true.

413
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,581
I just...

414
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,072
It's such a nice party.

415
00:29:02,675 --> 00:29:04,307
You'll get one too.

416
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,699
No.

417
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:09,144
I don't think I will.

418
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,276
Take off your shirt.

419
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:22,894
What?

420
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:25,510
I'm not gonna lie. You
drive me crazy sometimes.

421
00:29:27,894 --> 00:29:29,505
But we're in this together.

422
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:36,078
You're not alone.

423
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,475
Really?

424
00:29:42,644 --> 00:29:46,675
Think of it as an early
gift for your anniversary.

425
00:29:49,744 --> 00:29:51,191
You know what?

426
00:29:51,196 --> 00:29:54,526
Much as I hate to admit,
it looks better on you.

427
00:29:55,616 --> 00:29:58,120
That's wildly untrue.

428
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:00,973
But thank you.

429
00:30:05,874 --> 00:30:08,180
I'm gonna find something
to give you, too.

430
00:30:11,531 --> 00:30:13,511
Excuse me.

431
00:30:14,624 --> 00:30:16,234
That was nice of you.

432
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:20,667
Everybody needs a little
pick-me-up sometimes.

433
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:25,339
Can I ask you something?

434
00:30:25,941 --> 00:30:27,813
Sure.

435
00:30:28,217 --> 00:30:31,438
Uh, that girl that you...
That you kissed before?

436
00:30:31,693 --> 00:30:34,214
Who? Stacey? Yeah, she's great.

437
00:30:34,219 --> 00:30:38,958
Yeah, I'm just... I thought
you and Ellis were... together.

438
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:40,790
Oh. Oh, God, yeah. Yeah, no.

439
00:30:40,795 --> 00:30:42,753
Ellis, he's... he's my person.

440
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:46,240
That thing with Stacey, that's
just, you know, fooling around.

441
00:30:48,011 --> 00:30:49,839
Oh, okay.

442
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,865
Do you think...

443
00:30:55,483 --> 00:30:57,311
Could I kiss you?

444
00:30:58,938 --> 00:31:00,842
Oh, um, Julie...

445
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:03,230
No. I was... I was just
kidding. I didn't mean...

446
00:31:03,235 --> 00:31:06,503
- No, sweetie...
- No, you know what? Just forget it.

447
00:31:10,171 --> 00:31:13,285
So, this girl tells you she's
hearing voices and you just...

448
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:17,402
Look, I was skeptical.
Just like you, okay?

449
00:31:19,222 --> 00:31:20,480
But then...

450
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:23,748
she showed me this.

451
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,738
Look at that.

452
00:31:27,225 --> 00:31:28,313
That's the logo...

453
00:31:28,318 --> 00:31:29,714
I know what it is.

454
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:31,261
That was almost three years ago.

455
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:33,839
Sara and Nathan have been
here, what? Four, five months?

456
00:31:33,844 --> 00:31:36,944
All right, so you told
someone, someone told Sara...

457
00:31:36,949 --> 00:31:38,660
I never told a soul.

458
00:31:39,386 --> 00:31:42,816
Boyd, there was no possible
way she could have known.

459
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,637
Something was watching me that day,

460
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:46,903
the same thing that told Sara...

461
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:48,953
And you think this thing
is trying to help us?

462
00:31:49,499 --> 00:31:52,285
By killing an old man and a child?

463
00:31:53,465 --> 00:31:56,953
Whatever it is, it's a part
of the fabric of this place.

464
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,550
Okay? Whatever connection Sara has

465
00:31:58,555 --> 00:32:01,166
makes her valuable in ways we
may not even understand yet.

466
00:32:01,436 --> 00:32:03,917
Okay, now if you want to put
her in the box, that's fine.

467
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,706
I'm not gonna stop you.

468
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:09,574
But if you're serious
about finding answers...

469
00:32:09,705 --> 00:32:12,708
the fact that you're going on
this journey at the same time

470
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:14,839
that this connection is revealed,

471
00:32:15,803 --> 00:32:17,587
that's not just a coincidence.

472
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:20,370
That's providence.

473
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:23,441
So, what are you suggesting?

474
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:27,308
That we go with you, Sara and I. Okay?

475
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:29,550
We use this connection to our advantage.

476
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:31,605
So, a priest, a sheriff,

477
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:34,091
and a murdering psycho walk into a bar.

478
00:32:34,212 --> 00:32:37,464
Yeah, something like that, yeah.

479
00:32:38,028 --> 00:32:39,813
What?

480
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:59,978
If we go any deeper, we're
gonna need a taller ladder.

481
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,408
Well, we'll go as deep as we have to.

482
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:13,285
Here, come here.

483
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,771
Let me take a look at that.

484
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,991
I'm fine, really.

485
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:21,037
"Fine" is not a word I would use

486
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:24,808
to describe any of us at this point.

487
00:33:31,647 --> 00:33:34,467
- Ow!
- That's it. Yeah.

488
00:33:37,042 --> 00:33:39,214
- Oof!
- Little bit harder?

489
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:46,331
Why don't you take a break?
Go sit with Ethan for a bit.

490
00:33:46,336 --> 00:33:48,381
I'll take over here.

491
00:33:50,722 --> 00:33:52,957
Are you stuck on your antenna?

492
00:33:52,962 --> 00:33:55,980
- Yeah. Pretty much.
- Ow. Go slow, please.

493
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:00,386
Oh, my God.

494
00:34:00,391 --> 00:34:01,392
How's that?

495
00:34:01,397 --> 00:34:03,066
It's amazing.

496
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:53,102
Can I come in?

497
00:35:53,394 --> 00:35:54,769
I'd rather you didn't.

498
00:35:54,774 --> 00:35:56,292
Please?

499
00:35:56,636 --> 00:35:59,117
This is the only place in
this house I can be alone.

500
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:01,159
Well, sort of.

501
00:36:03,325 --> 00:36:05,022
- You look sad.
- Can I just come in?

502
00:36:05,027 --> 00:36:06,768
I'm having a really bad night.

503
00:36:13,363 --> 00:36:16,194
Are you going somewhere? It
looks like you're packing.

504
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:18,706
No, I'm just...

505
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:22,136
No. It's hard to explain.

506
00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:25,748
Why did you dig those graves?

507
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,188
I don't want to talk about that.

508
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:36,521
Are these from all the cars
that have come into town?

509
00:36:36,526 --> 00:36:38,267
Yes, that's right.

510
00:36:42,406 --> 00:36:43,979
On my first night,

511
00:36:43,984 --> 00:36:45,066
down by the pantry,

512
00:36:45,071 --> 00:36:48,081
you said that two cars hadn't
come to town on the same day

513
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:51,558
for a really long time,
and that it was special.

514
00:36:52,558 --> 00:36:53,994
Why?

515
00:36:54,628 --> 00:36:57,160
You've been here the
longest out of anyone.

516
00:36:58,261 --> 00:37:00,456
Do you know what this place is?

517
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:12,181
Seriously, man, I don't know why
you keep staring at that thing.

518
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:13,927
I'm sorry. Hold on.

519
00:37:15,842 --> 00:37:18,105
This page, it's...

520
00:37:19,477 --> 00:37:21,066
What?

521
00:37:21,071 --> 00:37:23,726
There's two pages stuck together here.

522
00:37:33,345 --> 00:37:35,813
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

523
00:37:35,818 --> 00:37:37,136
Huh.

524
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,087
Now, we're talking.

525
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,863
Victor!

526
00:37:59,589 --> 00:38:01,300
Holy shit.

527
00:38:03,263 --> 00:38:05,191
You're gonna go to a new home now.

528
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,503
I'm gonna give you to Fatima.

529
00:38:08,508 --> 00:38:11,605
She's gonna take such good care of you.

530
00:38:18,346 --> 00:38:20,596
What are you laughing at?

531
00:38:29,562 --> 00:38:30,867
Hi, Trudy.

532
00:38:30,872 --> 00:38:33,131
How... how do you know my name?

533
00:38:33,261 --> 00:38:35,046
We know all your names.

534
00:38:49,897 --> 00:38:51,681
I'm just saying...

535
00:38:53,652 --> 00:38:58,136
I've been here longer than
him. Deserve a little respect.

536
00:39:00,575 --> 00:39:03,074
I could really help this
place if they just...

537
00:39:03,204 --> 00:39:04,995
What the...?

538
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:07,066
Is that blood?

539
00:39:07,581 --> 00:39:09,495
Jeez...

540
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:11,610
What the...?

541
00:39:14,431 --> 00:39:15,706
Ah!

542
00:39:18,465 --> 00:39:22,144
They're in the house! They're inside!

543
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,714
Ellis? Have you seen Ellis?

544
00:39:42,331 --> 00:39:43,331
Ellis!

545
00:39:44,988 --> 00:39:46,339
Follow protocol!

546
00:39:46,344 --> 00:39:47,738
Where's the van?!

547
00:39:47,743 --> 00:39:48,875
Hide!

548
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,989
What's going on?

549
00:39:49,993 --> 00:39:51,168
It's starting.

550
00:39:51,196 --> 00:39:52,589
What? What's starting?

551
00:39:52,594 --> 00:39:53,908
We have to go.

552
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:55,218
Go where?

553
00:39:55,223 --> 00:39:57,425
Where are we going?

554
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,957
Go where? Hello?

555
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:02,425
Answer me!

556
00:40:09,237 --> 00:40:10,738
You go first.

557
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,769
I'll follow you down.

558
00:40:12,774 --> 00:40:15,850
Here. Take this.

559
00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:24,235
You ready?

560
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,285
Follow protocol!

561
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:43,250
Find your buddy! Get
into the van! Come on!

562
00:40:44,582 --> 00:40:45,801
Wait, Donna! What are you doing?

563
00:40:45,805 --> 00:40:47,831
- Where's Ellis and Julie?
- I don't know.

564
00:40:47,836 --> 00:40:49,511
- Hey, Donna!
- I am not running.

565
00:40:49,516 --> 00:40:51,106
Okay. You've gotta get
those people to town.

566
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,329
Save as many as you can.

567
00:40:52,334 --> 00:40:54,224
- Follow protocol.
- Okay, okay.

568
00:40:56,133 --> 00:40:58,011
All right, everyone. Out of the way.

569
00:40:58,016 --> 00:40:59,409
Get in the van!

570
00:41:07,075 --> 00:41:09,183
Oh, my God.

571
00:41:10,994 --> 00:41:13,449
Oh, my God. Hurry up!

572
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:21,082
We need to get to town.

573
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,838
- No. We have to go to the trees.
- Are you crazy?

574
00:41:27,843 --> 00:41:28,879
Those things live in there!

575
00:41:28,883 --> 00:41:29,934
- Please!
- They'll kill us!

576
00:41:29,938 --> 00:41:31,766
You have to trust me.

577
00:41:32,222 --> 00:41:33,789
If you want to see your family again,

578
00:41:33,794 --> 00:41:35,448
we have to go to the trees.

579
00:41:35,649 --> 00:41:37,245
Okay.

580
00:41:51,204 --> 00:41:53,136
No!

581
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,519
No.

582
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:49,218
No.

583
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:51,454
Baby, no way.

584
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:23,334
Ellis!

585
00:43:25,813 --> 00:43:28,112
- Hey.
- Hi. Have you seen Julie?

586
00:43:28,117 --> 00:43:29,675
I don't know. I can't...

587
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,951
Okay, we need to go.

588
00:43:30,955 --> 00:43:32,909
We need to run. Come on!

589
00:43:32,914 --> 00:43:34,370
Come on.

590
00:43:35,153 --> 00:43:36,886
No, I can't!

591
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:38,281
- Come on!
- I can't go! You just go.

592
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:40,525
I'm not going without you!
Come on, we can do this.

593
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:41,530
Up, up, up!

594
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,558
Up, up, up! We have to
get back in the house!

595
00:43:43,563 --> 00:43:46,065
We have to get inside!
I have an idea. Come on.

596
00:43:54,253 --> 00:43:57,368
Please! Please, please, please,
please! Please. Please...

597
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,714
Don't be like that.

598
00:44:00,133 --> 00:44:02,300
We were having so much fun.

599
00:44:37,635 --> 00:44:39,768
How'd you know that was gonna work?

600
00:44:40,242 --> 00:44:41,461
I didn't.

601
00:44:43,974 --> 00:44:46,706
With your dad and the RV I just...

602
00:44:59,914 --> 00:45:01,176
I'm sorry.

603
00:45:06,442 --> 00:45:08,175
I love you.

604
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,441
I love you too.

605
00:45:29,713 --> 00:45:31,613
- Where are we going?!
- There's another one here.

606
00:45:31,617 --> 00:45:34,094
- Another what?
- Come on.

607
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,605
You have to get inside.

608
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:37,839
- The tree? No! No!
- You'll be safe!

609
00:45:37,844 --> 00:45:39,410
- What?
- I promise.

610
00:45:39,415 --> 00:45:40,949
You have to find your
brother. You have to warn him.

611
00:45:40,953 --> 00:45:42,564
You have to tell him it's starting.

612
00:45:42,569 --> 00:45:44,237
I don't know what you're talking about!

613
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,472
He will.

614
00:45:45,477 --> 00:45:47,620
- Go, go, go!
- No, wait!

615
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:49,801
I'll be right behind you.

616
00:46:05,632 --> 00:46:08,374
If we do this, and I mean "if"...

617
00:46:08,379 --> 00:46:10,667
and she even blinks the wrong way...

618
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:13,460
You do what you need to do.

619
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:17,165
But we're goin' out there
and we're gonna find answers.

620
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:18,581
We're gonna find a way, Boyd.

621
00:46:18,586 --> 00:46:21,730
This, this is why I was
told to get back in the car.

622
00:46:22,206 --> 00:46:24,315
So that you and I

623
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,401
can go out there and find
a way to bring these people home.

624
00:46:28,204 --> 00:46:30,432
You're a fucking madman.
You know that, right?

625
00:46:31,323 --> 00:46:32,697
Bible's full of 'em.

626
00:46:36,276 --> 00:46:37,451
What the fuck?

627
00:46:40,073 --> 00:46:41,440
What happened?!

628
00:46:42,535 --> 00:46:44,232
I... what happened?!

629
00:46:44,237 --> 00:46:45,368
They got in and they...

630
00:46:45,373 --> 00:46:46,519
- Wait! Where's Ellis?
- I don't know!

631
00:46:46,523 --> 00:46:48,626
- Where is Ellis?
- I don't know! Sorry!

632
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:50,104
Everybody inside. Everybody inside.

633
00:46:50,109 --> 00:46:51,629
- Go! Let's go!
- Everybody inside now!

634
00:46:51,634 --> 00:46:53,893
- Let's go! Let's go! Hustle!
- Keep going! Keep going!

635
00:46:53,898 --> 00:46:55,410
- Let's go! Come on, man!
- Hurry, hurry, hurry! Inside!

636
00:46:55,414 --> 00:46:57,659
- Is that it? Is that it?
- Inside, everybody!

637
00:46:57,664 --> 00:46:59,190
Where are you guys going?

638
00:46:59,195 --> 00:47:00,812
You guys okay over there?

639
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:01,992
Father...

640
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,117
No!

641
00:47:04,122 --> 00:47:05,906
No, come here!

642
00:47:08,511 --> 00:47:10,078
Close it!

643
00:47:10,887 --> 00:47:12,259
Come on. You got it.

644
00:47:12,264 --> 00:47:13,940
Come on!

645
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:16,181
Keep him elevated.

646
00:47:16,186 --> 00:47:18,073
Get me something to stop the bleeding!

647
00:47:18,078 --> 00:47:19,737
- Please, no.
- Okay, it's okay.

648
00:47:19,742 --> 00:47:21,616
- Please!
- Let me stop the bleeding!

649
00:47:21,621 --> 00:47:22,831
Please... No.

650
00:47:23,444 --> 00:47:24,532
- You're okay.
- No.

651
00:47:24,537 --> 00:47:25,901
- You're okay.
- No...

652
00:47:25,906 --> 00:47:29,229
You're okay. You are okay.

653
00:47:29,234 --> 00:47:31,149
It doesn't end like this.

654
00:47:31,591 --> 00:47:34,913
My path... Please!

655
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,457
Hurry up!

656
00:47:37,023 --> 00:47:38,323
Okay.

657
00:47:38,328 --> 00:47:39,870
I got him.

658
00:47:39,875 --> 00:47:41,849
One...

659
00:47:41,854 --> 00:47:43,595
There we go. There we go.

660
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,932
Open your eyes. Stay with me.

661
00:47:45,233 --> 00:47:46,767
Stay with me.

662
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:48,377
Pray with me.

663
00:47:48,382 --> 00:47:50,558
- What? Okay.
- Pray with me.

664
00:47:50,563 --> 00:47:52,603
- Okay.
- Pray with me.

665
00:47:52,608 --> 00:47:54,011
Okay, okay.

666
00:47:54,432 --> 00:47:55,650
Our Father.

667
00:47:55,964 --> 00:47:58,909
Who art in Heaven,

668
00:47:58,914 --> 00:48:01,786
hallowed be thy name.

669
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:05,581
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

670
00:48:05,586 --> 00:48:08,371
on earth as it is in heaven.

671
00:48:08,641 --> 00:48:11,514
Give us this day our daily bread...

672
00:48:12,673 --> 00:48:14,762
and forgive us our trespasses

673
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:18,771
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

674
00:48:19,167 --> 00:48:21,212
And lead us not into temptation,

675
00:48:22,651 --> 00:48:24,651
but deliver us from evil.

676
00:48:27,422 --> 00:48:29,163
Amen.

677
00:48:29,746 --> 00:48:31,354
Amen.

678
00:48:32,426 --> 00:48:33,862
Amen.
