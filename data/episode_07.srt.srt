00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:18,829
Previously on From...

2
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,618
Nicky, stay with me, okay?

3
00:00:27,644 --> 00:00:30,509
Sheriff Boyd, I can't
take back what I did.

4
00:00:30,535 --> 00:00:32,165
You killed someone!

5
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:34,501
And you left two people
to die in that ambulance!

6
00:00:34,527 --> 00:00:36,032
- I know!
- One of whom

7
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:38,423
you handcuffed to a fucking wall!

8
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:39,493
I am sorry.

9
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:41,808
Miranda started seeing things.

10
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,586
She said it was like

11
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:47,259
she'd been chosen to free the children.

12
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:49,665
I guess you've been chosen now, too.

13
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:51,626
Miranda's the only one who had

14
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,954
a connection to this place
long before she arrived.

15
00:00:54,664 --> 00:00:58,658
What is this? Did you
see three red stones?

16
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:01,907
- How did you...
- When I was a little girl,

17
00:01:02,115 --> 00:01:06,369
I would have the same nightmare
over and over again.

18
00:01:06,395 --> 00:01:09,481
It wasn't just Miranda.
I saw this place, too.

19
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,035
If you'd seen the things I've seen...

20
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:17,290
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:17,316 --> 00:01:19,455
What do you think I'm
talking about, Boyd?

22
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:22,814
When me, Julie and Marielle,
wherever we were...

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,926
Everybody here just talks about
how afraid they are of dying.

24
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:28,603
Well, I don't think that's the worst
thing that can happen to you here.

25
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:30,861
I feel like something is watching me.

26
00:01:30,887 --> 00:01:33,275
Is that her? She looks scary.

27
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:39,954
Help me, Elgin. I can save all of you.

28
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:42,348
Donna, I was told I can't have kids.

29
00:01:42,374 --> 00:01:44,376
What's happening right now
is medically impossible.

30
00:01:44,402 --> 00:01:45,987
You're gonna have a baby

31
00:01:46,013 --> 00:01:48,517
that you were told you could never have.

32
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:51,845
With all you've seen, you can't
wrap your head around a miracle?

33
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:01,559
I don't see anything.

34
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:02,841
That's impossible.

35
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:05,426
You barely looked! Just keep looking!

36
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,153
You're not pregnant.

37
00:02:10,483 --> 00:02:12,988
And how long have these
cravings been going on for?

38
00:02:14,824 --> 00:02:17,410
About a week maybe?

39
00:02:19,613 --> 00:02:21,676
Guys, what is happening to me?

40
00:02:22,473 --> 00:02:24,324
Well, I mean, if we were anywhere else,

41
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,144
I'd say your body's exhibiting signs

42
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,449
of a psychosomatic pregnancy.

43
00:02:28,813 --> 00:02:30,387
And what is that?

44
00:02:30,413 --> 00:02:31,957
It's a fairly rare condition

45
00:02:31,983 --> 00:02:34,606
where your body believes it's pregnant.

46
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:37,286
It shows all the early
signs and symptoms of...

47
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:39,270
"Hysterical pregnancy."

48
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:42,004
Isn't that what they used to call it?

49
00:02:42,222 --> 00:02:45,762
Hey, no one here thinks
you're being hysterical.

50
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,113
It wasn't so long ago

51
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:51,137
that Boyd had worms under his
skin that no one else could see.

52
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:52,957
We're not ruling anything out here.

53
00:02:52,983 --> 00:02:56,344
And, I mean, you very well
could have been pregnant...

54
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,011
I am pregnant. It's still there!

55
00:02:59,037 --> 00:03:00,421
I can feel it.

56
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:02,488
Here. Just take a sip of this.

57
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:04,597
I don't fucking want that!

58
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,175
- Okay...
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

59
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:08,444
It's been a long day.

60
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,483
Your body's been under a lot of stress.

61
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,756
How about you stay the night?
Ellis can stay, too, and...

62
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:15,607
- I wanna go home.
- Fatima...

63
00:03:15,704 --> 00:03:18,043
- I just wanna go back to my room.
- It's raining outside, okay?

64
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:20,537
- I don't want you walking...
- You're worried about the fucking rain?!

65
00:03:20,563 --> 00:03:21,686
Okay.

66
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:25,705
Fatima!

67
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:27,577
Hey, you go. You should go.

68
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:29,201
Fatima!

69
00:03:29,227 --> 00:03:30,771
I wanna go home!

70
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:33,022
I'm gonna go stay the
night at Colony House.

71
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:35,327
- At least I can get an IV started.
- Yeah.

72
00:03:39,623 --> 00:03:42,381
You should've told me about all
of that before the ultrasound.

73
00:03:42,407 --> 00:03:44,577
- It wasn't my place.
- Really, Boyd?

74
00:03:44,603 --> 00:03:46,467
Now you wanna stand on ceremony?

75
00:03:46,932 --> 00:03:49,842
That was information I could
have used before the exam.

76
00:03:49,868 --> 00:03:52,081
I can't help, if I'm in the dark!

77
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,741
You wanna yell at me?

78
00:03:54,076 --> 00:03:56,161
Fine, but once you're done,
can we maybe figure out

79
00:03:56,187 --> 00:03:57,313
what we're gonna do now?

80
00:03:57,368 --> 00:03:58,584
I don't know what we're gonna do.

81
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,112
I don't know what's wrong.
Either way, she...

82
00:04:01,414 --> 00:04:03,833
she has something growing inside
of her that we can't see,

83
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:06,597
or this place has finally gotten to her
head and made her believe she's pregnant.

84
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:08,874
Okay. Then, how do we
figure out which one it is?

85
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,842
I don't know, Boyd.

86
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:12,405
Then how do we help her?

87
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:14,123
I have no fucking clue how to help her.

88
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:18,303
Okay. Then, do your fucking
job and figure it out!

89

www.subtitulamos.tv

90
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:35,448
I'm not scared. You need to talk.

91
00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:36,633
You...

92
00:06:36,932 --> 00:06:38,031
talk!

93
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:40,112
I know you can talk!

94
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:42,299
You need to talk to me!

95
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:47,282
Victor?

96
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,393
It's me. Can I come in?

97
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:23,195
Victor, you can't keep doing this.

98
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:26,986
You were up all night. You've
been in here all morning.

99
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:32,085
I could hear you yelling at
that thing from downstairs.

100
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:35,695
Son...

101
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:42,489
Now, this isn't healthy.

102
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:45,302
He needs... he needs to talk,
and he needs to tell me...

103
00:07:45,328 --> 00:07:46,755
- Hey...
- tell me what he said.

104
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:48,908
Yeah, but it's a doll.

105
00:07:49,264 --> 00:07:50,935
Right? I mean you...

106
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,122
You don't understand.

107
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,778
You weren't there.

108
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,557
Look, Victor,

109
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,544
- maybe just take a break...
- I can't do this here!

110
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,708
- No. Why don't... Victor.
- I can't do this.

111
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:03,934
Victor!

112
00:08:05,587 --> 00:08:07,464
Hey. Whatcha workin' on?

113
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,622
Oh, it's just a little...

114
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:12,333
I'm making this for Fatima.

115
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:18,524
You know, I thought, she's
been pretty down lately,

116
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,474
and I thought maybe this
might cheer her up.

117
00:08:21,153 --> 00:08:24,153
Well, that's just adorable.

118
00:08:24,314 --> 00:08:26,231
I'm sure she'll love it.

119
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:28,270
I hope so.

120
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:10,562
You're lucky that new ambulance came in.

121
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:15,155
All Kristi had before was
saline in glass bottles.

122
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:17,225
Yeah, so lucky.

123
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,562
Hey.

124
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:24,616
I know last night was a lot.

125
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:27,210
- Do you?
- I do.

126
00:09:27,327 --> 00:09:31,085
I also know what it's like to
feel violated by this place.

127
00:09:31,856 --> 00:09:34,525
What happened to me and
Julie and Randall,

128
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,523
there are still times
I can feel those bugs

129
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:37,800
crawling around inside me.

130
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:39,265
And what do you do?

131
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,109
I remind myself it isn't real,

132
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:42,812
that it's just fear,

133
00:09:42,838 --> 00:09:45,187
and fear can only break me if I let it.

134
00:09:45,213 --> 00:09:46,624
This is different.

135
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,210
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do!

136
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,981
Maybe you could just try
eating regular food again,

137
00:09:56,007 --> 00:09:57,713
just small bites.

138
00:09:57,739 --> 00:10:00,968
I'm not eating garbage
because I'm afraid

139
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:02,859
or broken.

140
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:06,671
It's happening because it's making me.

141
00:10:09,718 --> 00:10:11,210
Is everything okay?

142
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,990
Yeah, I was just finishing up.

143
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,250
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

144
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:42,230
She just cares about you.

145
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,855
Why isn't anybody listening to me?

146
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:48,510
It's happening inside of me.

147
00:10:48,536 --> 00:10:50,448
I'm the one experiencing this.

148
00:10:50,474 --> 00:10:52,081
Why is my fucking point of view

149
00:10:52,107 --> 00:10:53,971
the only one everybody assumes is wrong?

150
00:10:53,997 --> 00:10:55,870
Nobody's assuming that you're wrong.
Okay?

151
00:10:56,363 --> 00:10:58,948
We're... We're just trying to see this

152
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:01,271
- from every possible angle we can.
- And you?

153
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,065
Do you think
this is all in my head?

154
00:11:05,972 --> 00:11:07,159
Look,

155
00:11:07,948 --> 00:11:09,792
ever since that night at
the Sheriff's Station,

156
00:11:09,818 --> 00:11:11,456
when the bus pulled into town,

157
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,230
you broke down in my arms.

158
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,757
Do you remember that? You said
you couldn't take it anymore...

159
00:11:14,783 --> 00:11:16,456
- That you couldn't do this.
- This has nothing to do with that!

160
00:11:16,482 --> 00:11:18,113
Okay, so then tell me
what am I supposed to do?

161
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:19,503
Believe me!

162
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,378
Look, look, okay. Just...

163
00:11:24,473 --> 00:11:25,519
Look.

164
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,221
Just...

165
00:11:27,247 --> 00:11:30,125
I have been measuring every
single day since I found out.

166
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:31,980
- You just need to stop.
- And my stomach...

167
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:34,105
And my stomach is getting bigger.

168
00:11:34,131 --> 00:11:35,756
- Baby, it's not...
- Look. Look at it. Look.

169
00:11:35,802 --> 00:11:37,456
If this is in my head,

170
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:39,855
- how do you explain my body changing?
- I don't know.

171
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:40,894
Ellis...

172
00:11:41,136 --> 00:11:44,784
whatever is inside me,
it's getting stronger.

173
00:11:45,198 --> 00:11:47,144
The fucking cravings,

174
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,803
- they're getting stronger.
- Please.

175
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,488
- I'm angry all the time.
- It's okay.

176
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,005
If there's nothing there,

177
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,253
if the baby isn't real,

178
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,886
that means that it's me.

179
00:12:03,448 --> 00:12:05,964
I told her it was a miracle.

180
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:07,738
Yeah, we all...

181
00:12:08,846 --> 00:12:10,488
We all got a little excited.

182
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:15,019
You're sure there's no way
Kristi missed anything?

183
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,502
Donna, there was nothing there.

184
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,738
Nothing that showed up
on that machine anyway.

185
00:12:20,764 --> 00:12:22,534
So, the way Kristi sees it,

186
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:27,073
either there's something there, like
the worms that were under my skin,

187
00:12:28,144 --> 00:12:30,152
or this place finally got to her.

188
00:12:31,576 --> 00:12:32,869
Like Abby.

189
00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:36,183
Yeah, like Abby.

190
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,533
Look, if you're thinking about

191
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,284
things you could have done different...

192
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:45,136
- No, it's not that.
- Well, it should be.

193
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:46,659
Look,

194
00:12:47,362 --> 00:12:49,276
if it's some kind of fucked-up

195
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,471
worms-under-the-skin type thing,

196
00:12:51,802 --> 00:12:53,902
then that's a bridge we're
gonna have to cross.

197
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,935
But... if it's psychological,

198
00:12:57,961 --> 00:13:01,128
if she's anywhere near
the place Abby was in,

199
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,394
then we need to figure out
a way to bring her back.

200
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,573
Okay, well, let's just...

201
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:10,261
make sure this stays between us.

202
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,769
And then what?

203
00:13:14,223 --> 00:13:16,167
I'm gonna have a talk with Kristi later.

204
00:13:16,193 --> 00:13:18,684
Hopefully, she'll have had time to...

205
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,886
To what?

206
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:23,503
I don't know. Look.

207
00:13:24,008 --> 00:13:26,011
Look, I'm just telling you

208
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:29,198
'cause you and I promised not to
keep secrets from each other,

209
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,977
and she's living under your roof.

210
00:13:31,003 --> 00:13:32,777
Yeah, yeah.

211
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:35,393
About that...

212
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:37,769
While we're figuring it out,

213
00:13:37,795 --> 00:13:41,003
I don't think it's a good idea
that they stay at Colony House.

214
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,472
- What?
- Look, I am gonna be there for them,

215
00:13:44,498 --> 00:13:46,722
for you, every step of the way.

216
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:51,042
But the truth is, there are
two possibilities here,

217
00:13:51,068 --> 00:13:53,339
and each one poses a
different kind of threat

218
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,964
to the people of that house.

219
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:58,589
I have to think about
everyone here, Boyd,

220
00:13:58,615 --> 00:14:00,450
no matter how much I
wanna help you guys.

221
00:14:00,476 --> 00:14:03,144
Okay, I... I guess I can...

222
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,128
make some space at the
Sheriff's Station.

223
00:14:06,154 --> 00:14:07,906
- I gotta...
- Oh, Boyd, come on.

224
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:09,297
No, we're good. We're good.

225
00:14:09,323 --> 00:14:11,284
I'm not saying it has to be today.

226
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,148
I'm just saying it's something
we have to consider.

227
00:14:14,174 --> 00:14:16,863
I get it! You're not wrong! Okay?

228
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,683
You and me, we're okay. Just...

229
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:20,964
- I just...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know.

230
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:22,222
I know.

231
00:14:31,892 --> 00:14:33,322
This one's all right.

232
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:37,689
Let me help you.

233
00:14:38,547 --> 00:14:39,867
If we get going soon,

234
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:42,353
we should be able to make
pretty good time back to town.

235
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,843
Whatever was banging around last night

236
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,681
sure as hell didn't sound like
those things back in town.

237
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:49,509
Whatever it was,

238
00:14:50,548 --> 00:14:52,448
I'll be glad when this
place is in the rearview.

239
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,298
- Is this what was in your dream?
- Yeah.

240
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:58,993
What the hell?

241
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:02,064
Tabitha?

242
00:15:02,306 --> 00:15:03,439
Dad!

243
00:15:05,274 --> 00:15:06,313
Hey.

244
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:08,506
What happened?

245
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,322
- Nothing.
- Where's Julie?

246
00:15:10,348 --> 00:15:12,433
Oh, she's fine. Everything's okay.

247
00:15:12,797 --> 00:15:14,174
What the hell's going on?

248
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,827
Listen, it's okay. All right?

249
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,134
It was my idea.
She needed to come out here.

250
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,236
Why?

251
00:15:19,262 --> 00:15:21,264
Mom saw this place when she was little,

252
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,125
just like Victor's mom.

253
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,275
What?

254
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:26,712
Jim! You coming or staying?

255
00:15:28,384 --> 00:15:30,360
You guys go on ahead.

256
00:15:30,704 --> 00:15:32,650
- We'll catch up.
- Suit yourself.

257
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,634
Come on. Let's go look around.

258
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:36,422
Let's go.

259
00:15:44,892 --> 00:15:46,028
Hey.

260
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,348
You moving in?

261
00:15:48,432 --> 00:15:50,434
Yeah, I asked Kristi if I
could spend the night.

262
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,606
Why?

263
00:15:51,632 --> 00:15:53,137
My whole family's at the settlement.

264
00:15:53,163 --> 00:15:54,332
So?

265
00:15:54,358 --> 00:15:56,606
So, it's fucking creepy
in that house by myself.

266
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,230
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

267
00:15:59,262 --> 00:16:01,920
So, we got high on the bus together and
now you're gonna be all weird towards me?

268
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:03,660
I'm not being weird.

269
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:05,340
Where you going?

270
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:06,512
For a walk.

271
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:08,070
- Want some company?
- Nope.

272
00:16:08,096 --> 00:16:09,864
'Kay, let me put my bag inside.

273
00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:02,345
Oh, hey...

274
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,947
Sorry, we're not...

275
00:20:07,352 --> 00:20:09,345
We don't really serve food here anymore,

276
00:20:09,371 --> 00:20:11,102
if that's what you're hoping for.

277
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:12,712
Why is there a diner here?

278
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:14,188
Sorry?

279
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,181
And why is there a Sheriff's Station

280
00:20:16,207 --> 00:20:17,875
that looks like a post office?

281
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:20,654
Or a goddamn, travel agency sign?

282
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,243
I mean, what kind of
psycho built this place?

283
00:20:23,884 --> 00:20:26,673
You want me to go over them one
at a time or you want me...

284
00:20:26,699 --> 00:20:29,938
I wanna know why no one's
asking those questions.

285
00:20:31,684 --> 00:20:32,907
We did.

286
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:35,821
And?

287
00:20:40,302 --> 00:20:41,673
Want some tea?

288
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:45,742
This place is creepy.

289
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,210
Yeah, it certainly is.

290
00:20:52,248 --> 00:20:54,125
Who do you think lived out here?

291
00:20:56,574 --> 00:20:57,801
I don't know.

292
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,644
What do you think happened to them?

293
00:21:02,418 --> 00:21:04,389
Maybe... maybe they got out.

294
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,900
You know, maybe they went home.

295
00:21:06,926 --> 00:21:09,207
Just careful where
you're stepping, 'kay?

296
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:10,401
Why?

297
00:21:10,427 --> 00:21:11,808
Bear traps.

298
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:13,637
Seriously.

299
00:21:13,687 --> 00:21:16,607
I'm just saying, given
everything that's happened,

300
00:21:16,658 --> 00:21:18,035
there might be a part of you

301
00:21:18,061 --> 00:21:21,863
that wants so badly for all
of this to make sense.

302
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:23,652
Do you think I'm making this up?

303
00:21:24,447 --> 00:21:25,699
Of course not.

304
00:21:25,725 --> 00:21:27,017
You had a dream,

305
00:21:27,105 --> 00:21:29,480
a terrifying dream,
when you were little.

306
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:32,238
This wasn't just a
random nightmare, Jim.

307
00:21:32,513 --> 00:21:34,199
This was a dream I had,

308
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,535
over and over again, for months,

309
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:41,441
and every night, I would
wake up screaming.

310
00:21:41,611 --> 00:21:44,598
So, when I tell you that the totems here

311
00:21:44,624 --> 00:21:47,433
are the same ones that
I saw in my dream...

312
00:21:47,988 --> 00:21:50,762
what do you want me to do?
Give up? Stop trying?

313
00:21:50,788 --> 00:21:52,331
I don't know.

314
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,887
Look, Tabby, this place,

315
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:57,956
I thought I had it all figured out,

316
00:21:58,614 --> 00:22:00,777
and I almost got Donna killed.

317
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:02,582
And Sara?

318
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,449
She heard voices, and she
tried to murder our child.

319
00:22:05,475 --> 00:22:06,973
But that's different.

320
00:22:07,338 --> 00:22:09,871
- Why?
- Those things happened

321
00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:12,605
once we got here, but my dream...

322
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,739
I was a kid.

323
00:22:16,098 --> 00:22:17,855
I know you're scared.

324
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,480
I'm scared, too.

325
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,227
But these things are happening to me.

326
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:24,207
I-I can't pretend they're not.

327
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:26,144
One way or another,

328
00:22:27,223 --> 00:22:28,629
I need to know.

329
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:39,075
Okay.

330
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,363
So, my mom is convinced

331
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:46,418
that these creepy children she
keeps seeing need her help.

332
00:22:46,613 --> 00:22:48,676
And my dad's all, like, freaked out

333
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:50,812
'cause the last time he went down
a rabbit hole about this place,

334
00:22:50,838 --> 00:22:52,512
he almost
got everyone killed,

335
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,980
including this one complete idiot

336
00:22:56,006 --> 00:22:58,723
who tied Donna to a tree in
the middle of the woods.

337
00:22:59,342 --> 00:23:00,504
Yeah.

338
00:23:00,724 --> 00:23:01,957
Are you listening?

339
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:06,051
Yeah, of course. Yeah. Your mom
and the kids, rabbit stuff...

340
00:23:07,316 --> 00:23:08,683
What are you looking for?

341
00:23:09,219 --> 00:23:12,014
What? Chaga. It's a mushroom.

342
00:23:12,221 --> 00:23:13,574
Grows in cold weather.

343
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:16,769
Marielle and Kristi are on
some holistic foraging trip.

344
00:23:16,971 --> 00:23:19,027
So, where were you going, on the bus?

345
00:23:19,096 --> 00:23:21,504
Detroit. Like everyone else.

346
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:23,113
Why?

347
00:23:23,981 --> 00:23:26,879
To buy a car, so I didn't have
to ride the fucking bus anymore.

348
00:23:28,215 --> 00:23:29,660
- That true?
- No.

349
00:23:30,694 --> 00:23:32,529
I never even got my learner's permit.

350
00:23:32,972 --> 00:23:34,215
What?

351
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:36,957
Yeah, you're supposed to
get it when you're 15.

352
00:23:37,504 --> 00:23:39,923
Everything kinda stopped
after Thomas died.

353
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,668
That's your brother?

354
00:23:42,286 --> 00:23:43,316
Yeah.

355
00:23:43,894 --> 00:23:45,705
My dad was supposed
to take me to the DMV,

356
00:23:45,731 --> 00:23:47,980
but we never got back from our trip.

357
00:23:52,153 --> 00:23:53,476
All right...

358
00:23:53,995 --> 00:23:55,224
Come with me.

359
00:23:55,861 --> 00:23:58,379
- Where are you going?
- Can you just come on?

360
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,582
You have to understand,

361
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:08,676
things are a little different
when you first get here.

362
00:24:08,702 --> 00:24:12,039
I mean, you show up, and
you think to yourself,

363
00:24:12,065 --> 00:24:14,754
"I'm gonna figure this out.
All these other people,

364
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,738
they may have given up,
they may have accepted it.

365
00:24:18,764 --> 00:24:20,308
But me?

366
00:24:20,902 --> 00:24:22,518
I'm gonna figure this out.

367
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,082
I'm gonna be the one
who gets to go home."

368
00:24:25,108 --> 00:24:27,207
- And what's wrong with that?
- Nothing.

369
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:29,293
Completely normal.

370
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,369
But...

371
00:24:31,395 --> 00:24:34,043
given some time, it'll pass.

372
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,113
Pass.

373
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:39,126
Sorry. No, that's the thing.

374
00:24:39,152 --> 00:24:41,290
The whole idea of just
throwing up your hands

375
00:24:41,316 --> 00:24:43,464
and saying, "Oh, well, I tried"...

376
00:24:43,698 --> 00:24:45,167
That's not how I'm built.

377
00:24:45,257 --> 00:24:49,215
Right. You're not the type to
just accept the world as it is.

378
00:24:50,045 --> 00:24:51,046
What?

379
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,491
I've had this conversation before,

380
00:24:53,749 --> 00:24:55,715
and I've been on the other side of it.

381
00:24:56,258 --> 00:24:59,074
The thing you come to realize is that...

382
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,121
every...

383
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:04,355
question you're asking

384
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,098
has been asked before.

385
00:25:06,132 --> 00:25:08,009
Every theory that you have,

386
00:25:08,035 --> 00:25:11,316
someone else has had before
you, and at some point,

387
00:25:13,643 --> 00:25:16,854
you either adapt or you lose your mind.

388
00:25:18,382 --> 00:25:19,808
So, that's what you did?

389
00:25:20,463 --> 00:25:21,874
You adapted?

390
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:24,336
Me, I didn't really have a choice.

391
00:25:24,536 --> 00:25:26,043
When I first got here,

392
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:28,144
I was so busy taking care of
my dad that I was just...

393
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,457
Your dad?

394
00:25:32,972 --> 00:25:34,455
He passed away.

395
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,894
And your mom... she...

396
00:25:37,373 --> 00:25:39,144
she used to run the diner?

397
00:25:41,846 --> 00:25:43,806
You lost both your parents here?

398
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:45,652
Yeah.

399
00:25:46,284 --> 00:25:47,754
I'm really sorry.

400
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:50,754
Thanks.

401
00:25:51,486 --> 00:25:52,840
You're welcome.

402
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,566
What about, what about you?

403
00:25:55,592 --> 00:25:58,512
You have any... you have
a family back home?

404
00:25:58,742 --> 00:26:00,293
No, not...

405
00:26:01,168 --> 00:26:02,520
not really.

406
00:26:02,546 --> 00:26:03,644
Right.

407
00:26:05,418 --> 00:26:08,902
The good news is that
we have the talismans,

408
00:26:08,928 --> 00:26:10,941
and they keep us safe at night.

409
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:14,454
So, you know. I mean, that
wasn't always the case.

410
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,160
What the hell did people do before?

411
00:26:16,186 --> 00:26:17,433
They just...

412
00:26:17,551 --> 00:26:19,402
tried to hide as best they could.

413
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:21,433
Jesus.

414
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,932
Yeah. I wasn't here then.

415
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:27,176
There aren't many people left who were.

416
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:29,394
Where did they come from?

417
00:26:29,603 --> 00:26:30,910
The talismans.

418
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,254
Boyd.

419
00:26:33,496 --> 00:26:34,496
He...

420
00:26:34,522 --> 00:26:37,543
found 'em out in the forest one night.

421
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:40,144
So, that's why he acts like
the God king of the world.

422
00:26:40,543 --> 00:26:43,004
It's... not like that.

423
00:26:43,244 --> 00:26:46,207
You sure? I mean, no offense,
the guy's kind of a dick.

424
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:48,345
You, didn't exactly

425
00:26:48,371 --> 00:26:51,715
meet him under the
best of circumstances.

426
00:26:51,741 --> 00:26:53,183
He took my gun.

427
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:54,418
Can you blame him?

428
00:26:54,444 --> 00:26:56,715
You know, I'm gonna have to
carry the weight of that...

429
00:26:56,868 --> 00:26:58,433
of what I did,

430
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,465
for the rest of my life.

431
00:27:00,491 --> 00:27:02,676
I know that. But for him to f...

432
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,558
Hey, you know they have

433
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:12,775
tons of fresh clothes
up at Colony House.

434
00:27:12,801 --> 00:27:14,425
You'd be a lot more
comfortable, if you...

435
00:27:14,459 --> 00:27:17,574
You know, I don't want your
fucking fresh clothes, okay?!

436
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:20,691
No offense, really. I
don't want your tea.

437
00:27:20,817 --> 00:27:23,715
And I don't want your
adapt-or-die philosophy.

438
00:27:24,088 --> 00:27:27,918
I don't plan on getting
comfortable here, okay?

439
00:27:28,043 --> 00:27:29,816
I'm gonna figure the...

440
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,426
Yeah, they...

441
00:27:36,209 --> 00:27:37,621
They do that sometimes.

442
00:27:41,825 --> 00:27:44,090
Is that something else you
get comfortable with?

443
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,792
Look...

444
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:49,222
thanks for the tea.

445
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,965
You didn't even...

446
00:27:52,403 --> 00:27:53,746
Excuse me.

447
00:27:58,523 --> 00:28:00,098
She's taking it well.

448
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,433
Yeah. You need something?

449
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:06,558
Yeah.

450
00:28:08,471 --> 00:28:09,973
Yeah, actually.

451
00:28:11,535 --> 00:28:13,769
I was hoping I could talk to you

452
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:17,285
about reopening the diner.

453
00:29:03,746 --> 00:29:05,617
Is this really where it happens?

454
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,654
- Hi.
- Can I go in your basement?

455
00:29:21,154 --> 00:29:22,235
Why?

456
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:25,944
Because I need him to tell me a secret.

457
00:29:32,347 --> 00:29:34,648
'Kay, isn't this, like, for emergencies?

458
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,035
This is an emergency.

459
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,113
Just get in. Come on.

460
00:29:39,014 --> 00:29:40,027
Let's go.

461
00:29:46,356 --> 00:29:47,582
Okay.

462
00:29:49,384 --> 00:29:50,480
All right.

463
00:29:50,943 --> 00:29:52,011
Bingo.

464
00:29:52,382 --> 00:29:54,090
What you wanna do...

465
00:29:54,441 --> 00:29:55,949
you gotta pay attention.

466
00:29:56,989 --> 00:30:00,590
You turn it on, you press
in the clutch, okay?

467
00:30:00,813 --> 00:30:02,767
Make sure this has been shifted,

468
00:30:02,793 --> 00:30:05,790
then you're gonna ease
off the clutch, right?

469
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:08,509
Voilà.

470
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,082
Henry.

471
00:30:35,571 --> 00:30:36,800
You need something?

472
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,746
I could use a drink.

473
00:30:42,004 --> 00:30:43,261
You know what?

474
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,128
So could I.

475
00:30:52,098 --> 00:30:53,224
Let's go.

476
00:31:09,695 --> 00:31:10,944
Who's in there?

477
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:16,569
Hello?

478
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:29,596
What the fuck are you doing?

479
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,870
You took my gun. I want it back.

480
00:31:31,896 --> 00:31:32,901
You...

481
00:31:33,611 --> 00:31:34,745
Get out.

482
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,190
Fine. Give me my gun,
and I'll be on my way.

483
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:40,970
I don't have time for this today!

484
00:31:40,996 --> 00:31:43,143
I don't give a shit
what you have time for!

485
00:31:43,173 --> 00:31:44,713
You shot someone.

486
00:31:45,255 --> 00:31:47,159
A girl is dead because you panicked!

487
00:31:47,185 --> 00:31:49,653
Yeah, I panicked because I
was being chased in the dark

488
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,557
by things that should only
exist in a fucking nightmare!

489
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:54,104
Well, they exist here,

490
00:31:54,502 --> 00:31:56,893
and they're going to continue to exist.

491
00:31:57,192 --> 00:31:59,721
So, until you prove that
you can handle that,

492
00:31:59,747 --> 00:32:00,987
there is not a chance in hell

493
00:32:01,013 --> 00:32:03,354
you're getting anywhere
close to a loaded gun!

494
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:08,370
I don't have to prove shit to you.

495
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:10,104
You see this?

496
00:32:10,702 --> 00:32:11,924
I'm a cop.

497
00:32:12,522 --> 00:32:13,854
A real one,

498
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,549
not just walking around in
some hand-me-down blazer,

499
00:32:16,574 --> 00:32:17,955
playing make-believe.

500
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:19,018
Right.

501
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:22,370
And when did you get out of the academy?

502
00:32:23,432 --> 00:32:25,620
Two days? Three?

503
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,706
That's none of your business.

504
00:32:29,143 --> 00:32:30,909
That's where you are wrong.

505
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,737
Everything about you is my business.

506
00:32:34,713 --> 00:32:35,961
This place is my business.

507
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:37,487
- You know why?
- Why?

508
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,995
Because I'm the one who makes
sure people stay safe.

509
00:32:40,755 --> 00:32:43,901
I am the one who keeps people alive!

510
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,854
From what I hear,

511
00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:50,849
you've been doing a pretty
shit job of that lately.

512
00:32:50,963 --> 00:32:52,862
Get the fuck out!

513
00:32:58,153 --> 00:32:59,908
Fucking place...

514
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:06,627
Give me...

515
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,737
my gun.

516
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,229
You want your gun?

517
00:33:15,255 --> 00:33:16,495
Correct.

518
00:33:24,149 --> 00:33:25,825
You want your gun.

519
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:51,123
There's your gun.

520
00:33:53,318 --> 00:33:55,748
You get your bullets when
I think you deserve them.

521
00:34:05,306 --> 00:34:06,326
Hey!

522
00:34:09,688 --> 00:34:11,576
The next time you come in here

523
00:34:12,026 --> 00:34:13,576
without my permission,

524
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,428
you and me are gonna have a problem.

525
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:18,342
Whatever you say,

526
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,014
"Sheriff."

527
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:29,264
This fucking kid...

528
00:34:31,397 --> 00:34:33,241
I'd ask you what you were drinking,

529
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:35,389
but the menu here's kinda limited.

530
00:34:42,033 --> 00:34:43,998
Everything going all right with Victor?

531
00:34:45,061 --> 00:34:47,491
Things are going...

532
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:53,385
No, I don't think they are.

533
00:34:58,193 --> 00:34:59,444
You okay?

534
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,944
Yeah.

535
00:35:04,376 --> 00:35:06,819
I stood there today in his room,

536
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,897
and I...

537
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:13,983
I had a thought I'll never
forgive myself for.

538
00:35:14,686 --> 00:35:17,233
I wished I had never come here,

539
00:35:17,424 --> 00:35:20,873
I wished Tabitha had never found me,

540
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:26,983
because it was easier when
I thought he was dead.

541
00:35:28,582 --> 00:35:30,834
It was only for a second.

542
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:35,381
What kind of father thinks
that about his child?

543
00:35:43,269 --> 00:35:45,000
- Here.
- Yeah.

544
00:35:58,985 --> 00:36:01,488
Are these the same ones from your dream?

545
00:36:04,882 --> 00:36:07,957
It's not just the stones;
it's everything. It's...

546
00:36:09,874 --> 00:36:11,801
It's how it feels.

547
00:36:15,107 --> 00:36:18,340
I still remember the
fear when I was running.

548
00:36:24,143 --> 00:36:26,290
I started over there

549
00:36:28,243 --> 00:36:30,861
and came to hide behind the rocks.

550
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:33,267
Which one?

551
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:38,642
This one.

552
00:36:39,688 --> 00:36:40,954
And then what?

553
00:36:41,415 --> 00:36:43,501
Whatever was making everyone scream

554
00:36:43,527 --> 00:36:46,126
was on the other side of this rock.

555
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,572
And I would look up and...

556
00:36:50,073 --> 00:36:51,079
What?

557
00:36:51,942 --> 00:36:54,111
I would wake up every single time.

558
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:58,024
Okay, let's say you
actually did see this place

559
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,556
before we came here.

560
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,642
Yeah, like Miranda did.

561
00:37:01,861 --> 00:37:03,290
How does that help?

562
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:06,641
Maybe Aristotle got it wrong.

563
00:37:07,205 --> 00:37:10,939
Free will and determinism, it's...

564
00:37:12,629 --> 00:37:15,298
Miranda said she was chosen.

565
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,313
Right?

566
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:22,165
If seeing this place, you
know, visions, dreams...

567
00:37:24,227 --> 00:37:25,954
if that's the proof...

568
00:37:27,277 --> 00:37:30,113
and you saw this place as a child...

569
00:37:30,785 --> 00:37:33,181
You never really had a chance, did you?

570
00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:34,876
What do you mean?

571
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:38,158
If fate exists,

572
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,743
if you were destined

573
00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:42,448
to come to this place

574
00:37:43,168 --> 00:37:45,000
since you were a child...

575
00:37:47,262 --> 00:37:50,611
then, one way or another, you were always
gonna come to that tree in the road.

576
00:38:01,171 --> 00:38:03,024
How's Fatima doing?

577
00:38:06,188 --> 00:38:07,614
She's...

578
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:09,470
She's good.

579
00:38:10,106 --> 00:38:12,942
You know, we're just taking
things one step at a time.

580
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:14,697
You don't have to pretend.

581
00:38:15,072 --> 00:38:18,423
She told me about the rotten
food, about the cravings.

582
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:22,572
I realize you don't know me very well.

583
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:26,384
But if you need anything, I'm here.

584
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:34,064
We did an ultrasound last night.

585
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,258
- There was a machine on the ambulance.
- And?

586
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:41,040
- Is the baby okay?
- There is no baby.

587
00:38:41,066 --> 00:38:43,486
When Kristi examined her, she looked.

588
00:38:43,512 --> 00:38:45,040
There was nothing there.

589
00:38:45,775 --> 00:38:48,392
So, it's either there's something
inside of her that isn't

590
00:38:48,418 --> 00:38:49,986
human, that a machine can't see,

591
00:38:50,012 --> 00:38:53,072
or this place has just broken her mind.

592
00:38:53,997 --> 00:38:56,384
I can't lose her. I just...

593
00:38:58,073 --> 00:38:59,696
You haven't lost her.

594
00:38:59,722 --> 00:39:02,212
She's still here, Ellis.

595
00:39:03,845 --> 00:39:06,689
A good friend once said to me,

596
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:09,306
"Enjoy every moment,

597
00:39:09,332 --> 00:39:12,220
and don't grieve the living
before they're gone."

598
00:39:12,908 --> 00:39:14,954
And that's what I told my family

599
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,040
when I got my diagnosis.

600
00:39:19,293 --> 00:39:20,587
Are you afraid?

601
00:39:22,673 --> 00:39:23,876
Of dying?

602
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:27,392
Sure, at first, I was.

603
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:30,665
And then I got angry.

604
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:34,658
And one day, I realized
just how small life is,

605
00:39:34,684 --> 00:39:37,382
how it all goes by so fast.

606
00:39:37,593 --> 00:39:40,185
You start to wonder how
it could be anything

607
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,003
but the beginning of
some grand adventure,

608
00:39:43,029 --> 00:39:45,275
or maybe it's the middle,

609
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:47,884
but I don't think it's the end.

610
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:50,884
Not anymore. Once I realized that,

611
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,037
things didn't seem so scary.

612
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,626
None of us get to stay forever.

613
00:39:57,844 --> 00:40:00,361
I don't need forever. I just...

614
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:04,454
Whatever I can do, whatever you need...

615
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:07,454
well, it may not be much, but...

616
00:40:08,025 --> 00:40:09,283
I'm here.

617
00:40:14,405 --> 00:40:16,475
I'm sorry, but why? I mean,

618
00:40:16,913 --> 00:40:18,382
you barely know us.

619
00:40:18,554 --> 00:40:20,639
I'm old, and I have cancer.

620
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,757
I like a good love story.

621
00:40:22,975 --> 00:40:24,350
That work for you?

622
00:40:26,054 --> 00:40:27,139
Yeah.

623
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,319
Yeah, that works fine.

624
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,639
Come on.

625
00:41:11,103 --> 00:41:12,542
Help!

626
00:41:13,114 --> 00:41:14,674
Help!

627
00:41:18,046 --> 00:41:19,158
Help.

628
00:41:20,835 --> 00:41:22,104
Help!

629
00:41:23,015 --> 00:41:24,213
Fatima?

630
00:41:25,695 --> 00:41:28,127
Hey, babe, what's wrong? What happened?

631
00:41:29,866 --> 00:41:32,167
What's... What's happening to me?

632
00:41:32,245 --> 00:41:33,831
I don't, I don't...

633
00:41:34,399 --> 00:41:36,362
- Oh, God...
- I can't...

634
00:41:36,656 --> 00:41:38,112
- Ellis.
- It's fine.

635
00:41:44,654 --> 00:41:46,042
It's okay.

636
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:52,002
Goddamn, this feels good.

637
00:41:52,751 --> 00:41:55,174
- So, am I gonna get a turn or what?
- All right.

638
00:41:56,004 --> 00:41:58,721
Okay, okay. A promise is a promise.

639
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:02,190
Fuck.

640
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:05,431
What's going on?

641
00:42:06,362 --> 00:42:08,924
Nothing, nothing. The...

642
00:42:11,966 --> 00:42:13,463
Son of a bitch.

643
00:42:17,948 --> 00:42:19,196
Yeah, fuck you!

644
00:42:19,222 --> 00:42:20,596
What are you doing?

645
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:22,401
- You don't see 'em?
- See what?

646
00:42:22,427 --> 00:42:25,190
It's the fucking... it's the
fucking bugs! The ones that...

647
00:42:25,997 --> 00:42:27,893
No, no, no, no, no.

648
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:30,478
- Randall!
- Fuck you, man!

649
00:42:30,504 --> 00:42:31,909
Randall, stop!

650
00:42:34,601 --> 00:42:35,853
Randall!

651
00:42:35,879 --> 00:42:37,976
- Get the fuck off me!
- Randall, hey!

652
00:42:38,002 --> 00:42:39,995
- What are you...
- Get the fuck off!

653
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,174
What the fuck? What just happened?

654
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,206
Just go the fuck home.

655
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:49,635
- Hey!
- Get off me.

656
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:54,260
- Randall! Come back!
- Go home, Julie!

657
00:42:55,244 --> 00:42:57,689
- Hey! Put those back! Ellis!
- Look! She's in pain, okay?

658
00:42:57,715 --> 00:42:59,119
I need to do something!

659
00:42:59,145 --> 00:43:00,905
- Ellis! Hey!
- Thank you for all your help...

660
00:43:00,938 --> 00:43:02,329
What the hell is going on?

661
00:43:02,355 --> 00:43:04,774
Your son decided to come in here
and root the medicine cabinet!

662
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,142
Yeah, that's because that ambulance
has plenty of emergency medications!

663
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:10,033
- This isn't fucking aspirin we're talking about!
- Things that can make her stay calm, okay?

664
00:43:10,059 --> 00:43:11,947
These are powerful anti-psychotics!

665
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:14,108
- You have no idea what kind of damage
that could cause! - Okay, so what then?

666
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:15,845
What? What?
We're just gonna do nothing?

667
00:43:15,871 --> 00:43:18,626
Okay, you're not the one that's sitting
there, watching her go to pieces!

668
00:43:18,652 --> 00:43:20,322
No, I'm the doctor, okay?

669
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:22,991
And it is my job to use my
brain and not my emotions

670
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,775
- when making decisions.
- All right.

671
00:43:24,876 --> 00:43:29,642
Ellis, those pills in your hands
could make things a lot worse.

672
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:31,728
Give them back to me.

673
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:33,978
Give her the bottle.

674
00:43:36,692 --> 00:43:38,611
Give her the fucking bottle, man.

675
00:43:47,056 --> 00:43:48,079
Ellis!

676
00:43:48,697 --> 00:43:50,378
Ellis! Hey!

677
00:43:50,468 --> 00:43:53,259
- What?!
- Look, I know you're scared, man.

678
00:43:53,462 --> 00:43:54,978
What am I supposed to do?!

679
00:43:56,869 --> 00:43:58,572
Tell me, what the fuck
am I supposed to do?!

680
00:43:58,598 --> 00:44:00,431
- I don't know.
- Okay, I saw it!

681
00:44:00,457 --> 00:44:02,954
I saw what happened with
your fucking worms!

682
00:44:03,066 --> 00:44:04,548
And I saw what happened to...

683
00:44:04,941 --> 00:44:06,634
I saw what happened to Mom when she...

684
00:44:11,496 --> 00:44:13,876
Which fucking nightmare am I
supposed to be afraid of?

685
00:44:15,507 --> 00:44:16,696
Which?

686
00:44:18,804 --> 00:44:20,829
You know, she's fucking falling apart,

687
00:44:21,126 --> 00:44:22,626
right in front of me, and
I don't know what to do.

688
00:44:22,652 --> 00:44:24,251
I can't do anything to help her.

689
00:44:25,814 --> 00:44:27,462
Dad, I don't know how to help her.

690
00:44:27,787 --> 00:44:29,025
It's all right.

691
00:44:30,172 --> 00:44:31,383
Please...

692
00:44:32,681 --> 00:44:34,806
- Yeah.
- Don't let this happen, Dad.

693
00:44:39,508 --> 00:44:40,931
It's just...

694
00:44:51,851 --> 00:44:53,114
Randall!

695
00:45:01,621 --> 00:45:02,896
Randall?!

696
00:45:15,776 --> 00:45:17,005
Julie!

697
00:45:19,177 --> 00:45:20,622
What the hell is that?

698
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,263
I don't know.

699
00:45:28,653 --> 00:45:29,958
I don't know.

700
00:45:33,241 --> 00:45:34,802
What happened to you back there?

701
00:45:35,029 --> 00:45:36,905
Why did you just run off like that?

702
00:45:37,697 --> 00:45:39,365
I'll tell you on the way back.

703
00:45:39,785 --> 00:45:41,677
- Come on.
- Wait.

704
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:43,638
Do you feel that?

705
00:45:45,085 --> 00:45:47,880
Julie, we should go.

706
00:45:49,911 --> 00:45:50,911
No.

707
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,536
- No, I wanna check it out.
- Hey, hey, stop.

708
00:45:54,503 --> 00:45:55,629
Stop.

709
00:45:55,655 --> 00:45:58,013
You do. You feel it.

710
00:46:00,832 --> 00:46:02,291
I don't feel shit.

711
00:46:03,356 --> 00:46:04,394
Okay?

712
00:46:04,966 --> 00:46:06,083
It's gonna be dark soon.

713
00:46:06,109 --> 00:46:08,450
We gotta get that van
back to Colony House.

714
00:46:10,216 --> 00:46:11,591
All right, let's just...

715
00:46:12,591 --> 00:46:14,013
let's just go.

716
00:46:16,474 --> 00:46:17,715
Please?

717
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:04,765
Fatima?

718
00:47:04,817 --> 00:47:05,863
Fatima!

719
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:07,769
Listen to me.

720
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,627
- You're not alone.
- Please go.

721
00:47:09,653 --> 00:47:11,988
- I'm gonna help you.
- Don't touch me.

722
00:47:12,014 --> 00:47:14,003
Everything is gonna be okay.

723
00:47:14,029 --> 00:47:16,269
- Just go!
- It's gonna be okay.

724
00:47:16,483 --> 00:47:17,722
I said go!

725
00:47:20,196 --> 00:47:21,347
I'm so...

726
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,300
Tillie, Tillie. No, no.

727
00:47:24,347 --> 00:47:27,261
No, no, Tillie, Tillie, Tillie.
I'm so sorry.

728
00:47:27,287 --> 00:47:28,699
I didn't mean it.

729
00:47:29,652 --> 00:47:30,761
Help!

730
00:47:30,787 --> 00:47:32,886
Help! Help!

731
00:47:35,308 --> 00:47:37,386
You have to run.

732
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,113
Ellis, what have I done?

733
00:47:45,211 --> 00:47:46,660
What have I done?

734
00:47:46,685 --> 00:47:53,535
