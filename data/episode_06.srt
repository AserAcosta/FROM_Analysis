Previously on From...

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,420
I feel like I'm hanging on
by a thread here.

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,257
Those things, they never run.

5
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,098
They know there's only
so many places we can go.

6
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:20,625
I think we're running out of
spaces on the board, Sheriff.

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,268
I wish you had the luxury of
grief, but you don't, Boyd.

8
00:00:24,273 --> 00:00:25,945
These people need you.

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,882
You need to be the one
to lead these people home.

10
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:31,804
'Cause if you don't,
she died for nothing.

11
00:00:31,945 --> 00:00:34,828
Started getting tremors in
my hand a few weeks back,

12
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,289
which means the clock
is officially ticking,

13
00:00:37,294 --> 00:00:41,328
but I have this crazy idea
that might actually work and...

14
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,734
And if it does,

15
00:00:42,746 --> 00:00:45,880
I might be able to find a
way to get these people home.

16
00:00:46,082 --> 00:00:49,042
Something here is missing.
We just can't see it yet.

17
00:00:49,836 --> 00:00:51,350
I need something to write with.

18
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:53,664
Ask every question, right?

19
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,789
I don't just sit around

20
00:00:55,794 --> 00:00:58,640
fucking accepting the world as it is!

21
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:00,438
Someone is doing this,

22
00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:02,585
and I'm not gonna rest
until I figure out how.

23
00:01:03,754 --> 00:01:05,851
_

24
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,859
I really like you,

25
00:01:09,864 --> 00:01:13,515
and what's about to happen,
it's gonna save everyone.

26
00:01:13,918 --> 00:01:15,945
Where's my mom? I want my mom!

27
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,691
You're doing this for her!

28
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:18,781
Let him go.

29
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:20,132
They told me this was the last one,

30
00:01:20,136 --> 00:01:22,296
then everyone gets to go home!

31
00:01:23,524 --> 00:01:25,453
- Ethan, run!
- No!

32
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,968
You don't understand!

33
00:01:26,973 --> 00:01:28,679
- Nathan!
- Nathan.

34
00:01:28,684 --> 00:01:30,507
Nathan, please!

35
00:01:33,088 --> 00:01:34,414
Where is she?

36
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:35,899
She ran off into the woods.

37
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:37,523
And?

38
00:01:37,528 --> 00:01:40,953
And if she comes back before
dark, then we'll handle it.

39
00:01:41,171 --> 00:01:42,742
And if she doesn't?

40
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:46,109
If she doesn't, then it's handled.

41
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:09,829
Chaos and faith,

42
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:14,695
that is the duality of our existence,

43
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:17,447
from the moment we first arrive,

44
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:21,259
and not simply here in this town...

45
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:26,564
but in this world, in this life.

46
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:29,523
From the moment we
open our newborn eyes,

47
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,431
we are faced with a chaos we
cannot even begin to understand.

48
00:02:35,093 --> 00:02:37,243
And how do we respond?

49
00:02:37,248 --> 00:02:40,729
What is the very first sound we make?

50
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:42,858
We cry out.

51
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:46,462
We plead for answers,

52
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:50,378
before we even have words to
give voice to the questions.

53
00:02:51,825 --> 00:02:54,548
That's how we begin our
journey through this world...

54
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:57,506
terrified,

55
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,267
confused.

56
00:03:00,563 --> 00:03:03,814
And so, we search, and we strive,

57
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:06,173
and we stumble through the chaos.

58
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:11,439
We spend our lives looking
for signs that somewhere,

59
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:14,001
somehow there's a meaning,

60
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:17,681
a purpose to it all.

61
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,103
And then, one day, we find our faith.

62
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:27,399
Our faith that we are
each here in this world,

63
00:03:27,404 --> 00:03:29,095
in this place,

64
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,790
as part of God's mysterious plan.

65
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:37,377
In our faith, we understand
the chaos is the meaning.

66
00:03:38,242 --> 00:03:40,009
It is in our struggle,

67
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:44,439
in our search, that we find our purpose.

68
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:49,704
"Trust in the Lord with all thine heart

69
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,985
and lean not unto thine
own understanding."

70
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:57,767
- Amen.
- Amen.

71
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,790
It's always... it's always
nice to see new faces.

72
00:04:12,926 --> 00:04:16,407
Yeah, I'm, um... I just
came by to give you this.

73
00:04:17,597 --> 00:04:20,470
We've been packing up
the other family's stuff.

74
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:22,751
I figured they were yours.

75
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,665
Yeah.

76
00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:28,790
How's Ethan doing?

77
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:31,734
Well, he's, um...

78
00:04:32,192 --> 00:04:34,915
He's scared and confused.

79
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,337
He doesn't understand why
Sara would try to hurt him.

80
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:38,359
Mm.

81
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:41,681
Has anyone seen her?

82
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:44,165
Not since she ran off into the woods.

83
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,212
Mm.

84
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:47,175
I ran after her, but...

85
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:50,484
my knees aren't quite what
they used to be, I'm afraid.

86
00:04:51,656 --> 00:04:53,540
Do you think she's still alive?

87
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:55,954
It's unlikely she survived the night.

88
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,774
Those Bible passages, did you...

89
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:01,085
Did you write those from memory?

90
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:06,228
Yeah. Word for word.

91
00:05:06,303 --> 00:05:08,218
It tends to stick.

92
00:05:11,604 --> 00:05:15,608
Um, what did you really
come here to ask me, Tabitha?

93
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:25,907
How do you know any of this is real?

94
00:05:27,312 --> 00:05:29,749
I mean...

95
00:05:30,043 --> 00:05:34,118
It sounds crazy, but are
we dead? Are we alive?

96
00:05:36,061 --> 00:05:37,860
Would it matter?

97
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:41,329
I mean, for argument's
sake, let's say we're dead,

98
00:05:42,285 --> 00:05:44,723
and we're all stuck here
together in some strange,

99
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:46,121
tormented purgatory.

100
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:49,798
What would be different?
We'd still be stuck.

101
00:05:50,874 --> 00:05:52,876
We'd still be searching
for a way to go home.

102
00:05:53,193 --> 00:05:56,634
All that would change is
the home we're searching for.

103
00:05:56,887 --> 00:05:58,649
Yeah.

104
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,462
I mean, I'm guessing
I'm not the first person

105
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:03,329
to come to you with that question.

106
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:04,345
Well, let's just say

107
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,696
I've had plenty of chances
to work on my answer.

108
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:07,876
Yeah.

109
00:06:08,278 --> 00:06:10,585
But if it's any consolation to you,

110
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:13,673
you were already here
when your vehicle crashed.

111
00:06:14,702 --> 00:06:17,688
You're alive, Tabitha.
Your family's alive.

112
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:21,389
So you can scratch that
question off your list.

113
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,885
Yeah.

114
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:28,196
- Bye.
- Yeah.

115
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:50,971
We need to talk.

116
00:10:00,221 --> 00:10:01,502
You all right?

117
00:10:01,507 --> 00:10:03,432
Yeah, it...

118
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:07,667
I'm having a hard time wrapping
my brain around it, I guess.

119
00:10:07,672 --> 00:10:09,893
I mean, it's Sara, you know?

120
00:10:09,898 --> 00:10:13,565
She was always so thoughtful, so nice.

121
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,486
- How's your mom taking it?
- It's hard.

122
00:10:16,985 --> 00:10:20,598
You know, Sara was kind of
like the daughter she never had.

123
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,049
I been thinking about what
you said the other day,

124
00:10:26,468 --> 00:10:28,362
about running out of room on the board.

125
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:29,776
I was upset.

126
00:10:29,938 --> 00:10:31,815
Well, it doesn't mean you're wrong.

127
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:34,510
Something's changing here. It's like...

128
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:37,431
like something's slipping away.

129
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:40,643
The other night, the
talisman worked out in the RV,

130
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,101
same way it does in the houses.

131
00:10:43,106 --> 00:10:44,385
And?

132
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,229
And I've been thinking
that the only reason

133
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:50,885
we haven't pushed
further into the forest

134
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,510
is we didn't know whether the talisman

135
00:10:52,515 --> 00:10:55,346
would protect us out there
the same way it does in the town.

136
00:10:56,785 --> 00:10:58,309
So...

137
00:10:58,314 --> 00:11:00,260
I'm putting together some supplies.

138
00:11:00,265 --> 00:11:02,143
I'm gonna take the talisman

139
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:05,238
and go out in the forest
and I'm gonna see...

140
00:11:05,848 --> 00:11:07,971
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

141
00:11:07,976 --> 00:11:09,479
Kenny, what...

142
00:11:10,394 --> 00:11:12,901
Hey! You don't walk away
when I'm talking to you!

143
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:14,678
Are you going alone?

144
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:15,902
Yeah.

145
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,417
And how far are you going?

146
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:19,902
As far as it'll take me.

147
00:11:20,218 --> 00:11:22,440
I'm doin' this to find a way out,

148
00:11:22,445 --> 00:11:24,362
find a way home. Isn't that the point?

149
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:25,589
Make sure we all get home?

150
00:11:25,594 --> 00:11:27,031
Honestly?

151
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:30,315
I'm not sure there is a point anymore.

152
00:11:30,888 --> 00:11:33,534
But if you're in that much
of a hurry to fuckin' die,

153
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:35,454
you should just go and do it.

154
00:11:35,712 --> 00:11:37,453
Okay?

155
00:11:47,815 --> 00:11:49,004
I got everything packed up.

156
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,799
It's ready to go to storage.

157
00:11:50,804 --> 00:11:52,401
Oh, okay.

158
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:56,381
What are you up to?

159
00:11:59,664 --> 00:12:00,664
Look.

160
00:12:04,388 --> 00:12:05,694
There's no wire in here.

161
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:08,912
- What?
- In the cord.

162
00:12:09,433 --> 00:12:10,943
When you want to splice a wire,

163
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:13,202
you gotta strip away the coating
to get at the wire inside.

164
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:15,662
But there's no wire. This is...

165
00:12:15,832 --> 00:12:17,990
You know, it's not actually a wire.

166
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:19,910
And the plug?

167
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:21,561
Look.

168
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:23,014
Look.

169
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:27,795
The outlets, none of it makes any sense.

170
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,678
I mean, these lamps,
they shouldn't work.

171
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:30,748
Hello!

172
00:12:30,753 --> 00:12:33,021
Ah, you, uh, rollercoaster guy,

173
00:12:33,026 --> 00:12:35,201
- I need your help.
- You don't knock?

174
00:12:35,206 --> 00:12:36,772
I'm sorry, would you like
me to take off my shoes too?

175
00:12:36,776 --> 00:12:38,835
You noticed the wire thing
too, huh? Fucking weird, right?

176
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:41,494
You're that asshole
that almost killed us.

177
00:12:44,323 --> 00:12:46,928
Okay, look, first of
all, I wasn't driving.

178
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:48,326
Second, my best friend,

179
00:12:48,331 --> 00:12:50,373
who I've known since fourth
grade, is dead. All right?

180
00:12:50,377 --> 00:12:52,280
He's not walking around with
a little boo-boo on his leg.

181
00:12:52,284 --> 00:12:54,062
So, how about we just
call that one even, okay?

182
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:58,389
Now, you guys wanna play
house or do you wanna go home?

183
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,967
Because I have an idea.

184
00:13:03,727 --> 00:13:05,545
Did you know there's not a single copy

185
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,123
of the Bible in town?

186
00:13:08,965 --> 00:13:11,803
I mean, in our little
traveler's library in the diner,

187
00:13:11,808 --> 00:13:16,029
there's at least a dozen Robert
Ludlum and Judy Blume novels,

188
00:13:16,034 --> 00:13:17,443
yet...

189
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,795
not a single copy of the
world's most popular book.

190
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:29,895
I imagine you wonder why you're here.

191
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,068
You've done such unspeakable things.

192
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:42,068
And by the rules of the town,
you should be in the box.

193
00:13:51,476 --> 00:13:54,342
Nathan told me about the voices.

194
00:13:58,114 --> 00:13:59,637
It's okay.

195
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:10,607
Sara, what if I were to tell you

196
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,529
that despite the horrible
things you've done,

197
00:14:15,216 --> 00:14:18,263
you can still help
the people of this town?

198
00:14:18,268 --> 00:14:20,490
You could still do something good.

199
00:14:22,034 --> 00:14:25,124
I think Nathan would
like that, don't you?

200
00:14:26,797 --> 00:14:27,797
Yeah?

201
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:31,503
Good.

202
00:14:37,874 --> 00:14:39,267
Those are pretty.

203
00:14:39,272 --> 00:14:40,287
Right?

204
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:41,764
You have a good eye, Miss Matthews.

205
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:43,303
Oh, I just found them like this.

206
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:44,657
Like what?

207
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:46,904
Arranged like this.

208
00:14:46,909 --> 00:14:49,390
They were on the porch
on the side of the house.

209
00:14:50,112 --> 00:14:51,365
Huh.

210
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,764
Well, it seems we have a
phantom florist running around.

211
00:14:55,065 --> 00:14:57,061
Come on. It's laundry day.

212
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,759
Come on.

213
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:05,657
Ow!

214
00:15:05,662 --> 00:15:08,143
Motherfucker! Come on!

215
00:15:08,531 --> 00:15:09,531
Ugh.

216
00:15:11,381 --> 00:15:13,381
These people are ding-dongs.
They stripped the car.

217
00:15:13,386 --> 00:15:15,545
They leave behind the only
parts that actually matter.

218
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,951
They're not all ding-dongs.

219
00:15:16,956 --> 00:15:18,545
- Battery's gone.
- Huh?

220
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,506
I said, the battery is gone.

221
00:15:23,558 --> 00:15:25,473
That means we gotta go back to town.

222
00:15:25,478 --> 00:15:28,654
Wait, just as soon as
I get this cable here.

223
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:30,279
Goddamn it, come on.

224
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,365
Why all the way out here?

225
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,590
We literally could've gotten
wiring from any car in town.

226
00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:41,131
My friend, this is
a top-of-the-line Audi Q5.

227
00:15:41,136 --> 00:15:42,639
Parts sourced from...

228
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:45,576
You really wanna pin our hopes
to some peasant model jalopy?

229
00:15:46,796 --> 00:15:48,193
Yep.

230
00:15:48,843 --> 00:15:50,389
You got all that?

231
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:55,498
Whoo! We're doing it!

232
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:56,548
Science!

233
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:09,490
Good morning.

234
00:16:09,495 --> 00:16:12,389
Uh, I'm dropping these off for storage.

235
00:16:24,823 --> 00:16:26,146
Hey.

236
00:16:26,878 --> 00:16:29,924
Honey, she's not here.
She's not gonna hurt you.

237
00:16:30,142 --> 00:16:31,621
Promise?

238
00:16:32,102 --> 00:16:33,582
Yeah, I promise.

239
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:38,834
Come on.

240
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:45,406
Where should I...?

241
00:16:47,026 --> 00:16:50,443
Wow. Look at all this stuff.

242
00:16:57,623 --> 00:16:59,060
Hey.

243
00:16:59,236 --> 00:17:00,542
Don't touch anything.

244
00:17:00,547 --> 00:17:01,717
Why?

245
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:05,170
Because this... this used
to belong to other people.

246
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:07,075
The people who lived here?

247
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,287
Mm-hmm.

248
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:09,510
Oh.

249
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:14,195
It's like the cavern
of the lonely dragon.

250
00:17:14,544 --> 00:17:15,850
Yeah?

251
00:17:15,855 --> 00:17:18,771
When the Cromenockle was
lost in the rainbow sky,

252
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:21,909
she found a cavern where
the lonely dragon lived,

253
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,390
and it was full of
stuff that nobody wanted.

254
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,335
But for the lonely dragon,

255
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,405
all the stuff was treasure.
And guess what.

256
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,716
What?

257
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:36,007
In one of the big piles of stuff,

258
00:17:36,012 --> 00:17:38,436
there was the map of the rainbow sky.

259
00:17:39,646 --> 00:17:43,345
So, the lonely dragon
gave it to the Cromenockle

260
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,897
and then she wasn't lost anymore.

261
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,046
So maybe we'll find a map in here.

262
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:50,880
Yeah, maybe we will.

263
00:17:59,987 --> 00:18:01,510
Mom?

264
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:02,733
Yeah.

265
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:05,093
What's wrong?

266
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,038
Nothing.

267
00:18:14,114 --> 00:18:18,147
Yeah, this is it, this one, right here.

268
00:18:22,427 --> 00:18:23,864
Oh, this'll never work.

269
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,262
Of course, it's going to work.

270
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,436
No, it's not nearly tall enough.

271
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:30,601
It won't have the signal strength.

272
00:18:30,605 --> 00:18:31,692
Yeah, listen, we can
deal with that, okay?

273
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:35,804
This is just a test run. Look,
you're an engineer, right?

274
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:37,466
- Amusement parks?
- Yeah.

275
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:40,311
Okay. So, I guess that
means one of us built

276
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:42,144
a multi-million-dollar software company

277
00:18:42,149 --> 00:18:45,021
and the other does, what,
safety tests on the teacup ride?

278
00:18:48,077 --> 00:18:50,686
You know what? Do it yourself.

279
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:55,171
Huh? Wait, no, no! Hey, look.
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

280
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,129
People tell me I'm not
great when it comes to

281
00:18:57,134 --> 00:18:58,695
talking to people. You have
no idea what it's like

282
00:18:58,699 --> 00:18:59,828
being smarter than everyone you know.

283
00:18:59,832 --> 00:19:02,182
Listen, okay, look, the truth is...

284
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:04,905
I could really use your help.

285
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,874
Yeah, you could.

286
00:19:07,911 --> 00:19:10,850
This antenna, it has to go up high.

287
00:19:10,855 --> 00:19:13,866
That is the highest tree that
I could find, but I... I can't.

288
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:16,264
I get vertigo.

289
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:20,147
So, you brought me out
here to climb a tree?

290
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:24,069
Yeah.

291
00:19:25,472 --> 00:19:26,778
Listen, you don't like me.

292
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:28,577
All right? That's fine.

293
00:19:30,233 --> 00:19:32,730
But if there's even the slightest chance

294
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:36,921
this could work, don't
you want to know for sure?

295
00:19:39,384 --> 00:19:43,140
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

296
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:47,358
Okay.

297
00:19:47,363 --> 00:19:48,625
All right.

298
00:19:54,575 --> 00:19:56,733
All right. Pass me up the cable?

299
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:18,985
Kristi, you here?

300
00:21:02,183 --> 00:21:03,790
Sheriff Boyd?

301
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:06,970
Kristi, hey.

302
00:21:07,637 --> 00:21:09,391
I-I was just, uh...

303
00:21:09,396 --> 00:21:10,907
I didn't see you upstairs, so...

304
00:21:10,912 --> 00:21:12,415
Everything okay?

305
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,431
I know you and Kenny are
close, and I was just, uh...

306
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:19,251
How's he doing?

307
00:21:19,616 --> 00:21:21,579
Well, I mean...

308
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:25,735
I think he's... been
having a hard time since...

309
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,587
Right, right.

310
00:21:27,592 --> 00:21:29,149
And I-I think he's trying really hard

311
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:31,337
to be this person that he
thinks people need him to be,

312
00:21:31,342 --> 00:21:33,790
if that makes sense?

313
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:35,231
Yeah.

314
00:21:35,743 --> 00:21:37,704
Being your deputy and...

315
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:40,277
and I know a big thing for him

316
00:21:40,282 --> 00:21:42,157
is he doesn't want to let you down.

317
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:46,235
I know. And I'm really trying
not to push him too hard.

318
00:21:46,786 --> 00:21:48,403
The truth is, he needs
to be ready to lead.

319
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,800
Can I be honest with you?

320
00:21:49,805 --> 00:21:51,181
Please.

321
00:21:52,084 --> 00:21:54,173
I get that you want to
prepare him for the worst,

322
00:21:54,178 --> 00:21:57,173
get him ready to take your
place in case something ever...

323
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:01,352
But right now, he's really hurting,

324
00:22:01,357 --> 00:22:03,282
and I don't think he needs a sheriff.

325
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:04,852
I think he needs a dad.

326
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,251
Goddamn it.

327
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:12,175
I'm sorry, I...

328
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,181
No, no, no.

329
00:22:13,186 --> 00:22:15,009
It's... It's not you. It's me.

330
00:22:15,014 --> 00:22:17,190
It's...

331
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:19,829
If you don't learn from your mistakes,

332
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:21,274
you're doomed to repeat them, right?

333
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,235
I really didn't mean to...

334
00:22:24,586 --> 00:22:26,868
- You didn't.
- No apology.

335
00:22:29,877 --> 00:22:31,575
Thank you, Kristi.

336
00:22:53,931 --> 00:22:56,613
People think the Bible's
a fixed object...

337
00:22:57,741 --> 00:23:01,011
something written, completed.

338
00:23:02,738 --> 00:23:04,044
But how can the story be finished

339
00:23:04,048 --> 00:23:06,527
if all the players remain on stage?

340
00:23:07,876 --> 00:23:10,301
We call it "the Good Book", but...

341
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:15,847
Did you know it's actually
comprised of 73 books?

342
00:23:16,372 --> 00:23:17,894
Did you know that?

343
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:23,207
Matthew, Mark,

344
00:23:23,663 --> 00:23:25,709
Romans, Corinthians.

345
00:23:25,714 --> 00:23:27,808
Seventy-three books.

346
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:33,480
All filled with tales
of miracle and wonder.

347
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:40,480
But there's also darkness in the Bible.

348
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:44,805
Gruesome, horrible things.

349
00:23:46,163 --> 00:23:47,947
You know, since...

350
00:23:47,952 --> 00:23:50,075
Since the night I arrived,

351
00:23:51,873 --> 00:23:55,006
there seems to be a question
I keep coming back to.

352
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:03,557
Seventy-three books.

353
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,988
What if we,

354
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:10,082
the people of this town,

355
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:14,611
are living the book that
has yet to be written?

356
00:24:16,412 --> 00:24:19,284
What if this is Book 74?

357
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:27,176
And, Sara, what if we were chosen?

358
00:24:28,742 --> 00:24:30,396
For what?

359
00:24:33,301 --> 00:24:35,434
I don't know.

360
00:24:38,948 --> 00:24:43,097
Which is why I need you to
tell me about these voices.

361
00:24:47,161 --> 00:24:48,815
Please.

362
00:24:56,229 --> 00:24:58,527
When's Dad coming home?

363
00:25:00,445 --> 00:25:02,019
Soon, honey.

364
00:25:02,024 --> 00:25:03,871
I don't think he will be much longer.

365
00:25:06,897 --> 00:25:08,203
What's wrong?

366
00:25:09,545 --> 00:25:12,019
Nothing. I'm just...

367
00:25:12,926 --> 00:25:16,230
Just admiring this piece
of lonely dragon's treasure.

368
00:25:16,455 --> 00:25:18,326
It's pretty.

369
00:25:19,204 --> 00:25:20,771
Yeah.

370
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:26,286
Why does that light keep turning off?

371
00:25:30,307 --> 00:25:32,004
I don't know.

372
00:25:33,525 --> 00:25:36,011
How about you and I have an adventure?

373
00:25:36,016 --> 00:25:37,683
What kind of adventure?

374
00:25:37,688 --> 00:25:41,926
Mm, some sort of, um, treasure hunt.

375
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:44,074
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

376
00:25:44,232 --> 00:25:46,017
Yeah, the game's gonna be called,

377
00:25:46,022 --> 00:25:48,316
"Where does the light come from?"

378
00:25:49,629 --> 00:25:50,769
Sounds good?

379
00:25:50,774 --> 00:25:52,621
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

380
00:25:52,626 --> 00:25:57,308
Let's go. Okay, we will
need some tools, right?

381
00:25:57,313 --> 00:25:58,488
Mm-hmm.

382
00:25:58,493 --> 00:26:01,278
Ooh, I found your tool!

383
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,261
Let's see if I've...

384
00:26:05,612 --> 00:26:07,340
found my tool.

385
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:09,652
Okay.

386
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,388
Let's move this.

387
00:26:14,637 --> 00:26:17,901
Come on, honey. I need
you to push. Help me.

388
00:26:22,467 --> 00:26:24,504
Okeydokey.

389
00:26:24,612 --> 00:26:27,504
Now, this is your tool.

390
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:29,652
This is my tool. Ready?

391
00:26:31,042 --> 00:26:32,620
Mom!

392
00:26:34,904 --> 00:26:36,543
You're doin' great!

393
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:44,944
Here we go.

394
00:26:51,921 --> 00:26:54,426
Hey, I'm snagged somewhere.
Can you see where it's caught?

395
00:26:54,443 --> 00:26:56,285
Uh, no, not really.

396
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:59,457
Just, uh, give it a shake,
see if you can wiggle it free.

397
00:27:02,315 --> 00:27:03,925
Yeah, that's it.

398
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,246
- You got it?
- Yup.

399
00:27:12,735 --> 00:27:14,074
All right.

400
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:16,926
Okay. How you doing up there?

401
00:27:16,931 --> 00:27:18,846
Doing good.

402
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,332
Fuck!

403
00:27:23,243 --> 00:27:25,028
Oh, Jesus.

404
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:53,676
No, no, no! No!

405
00:28:13,699 --> 00:28:15,644
No, no, no! No, no!

406
00:28:20,123 --> 00:28:21,621
No, no!

407
00:28:22,709 --> 00:28:25,840
Hey. Hey.

408
00:28:26,761 --> 00:28:28,633
Jade, wh...

409
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:31,783
Jade, Jade, right here. Right here.

410
00:28:31,788 --> 00:28:34,746
Listen, whatever it
is, it's not real. Okay?

411
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:36,886
There's nothing there.

412
00:28:38,054 --> 00:28:39,216
Jade, I'm going to help you up.

413
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,873
Come here. Come here.

414
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:42,949
You okay? Huh?

415
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:44,426
Just get your fucking hands off me!

416
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:45,911
What did you see?

417
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:48,204
Just fuck off, all right?

418
00:28:53,386 --> 00:28:55,597
They said they wanted to help.

419
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:58,217
That they'd been here a long time

420
00:28:59,121 --> 00:29:00,230
and they'd been waiting

421
00:29:00,235 --> 00:29:03,020
for someone to come who would hear them,

422
00:29:03,737 --> 00:29:05,136
someone who could help them.

423
00:29:05,141 --> 00:29:06,316
Help them do what?

424
00:29:06,321 --> 00:29:08,323
Help them escape.

425
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:10,475
Help them go home.

426
00:29:11,505 --> 00:29:13,777
They said they were just like us.

427
00:29:13,782 --> 00:29:17,363
But why? Why did you believe them?

428
00:29:18,499 --> 00:29:22,285
Because... they told me things,

429
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,824
things they couldn't know.

430
00:29:25,642 --> 00:29:28,332
They told me those two cars were coming

431
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:32,675
and to stand out near the
edge of town and I would see.

432
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,081
They said it happened before,

433
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:39,761
that two cars came on the same day

434
00:29:40,285 --> 00:29:42,277
and everyone died.

435
00:29:43,196 --> 00:29:45,720
They said it was because of the
people in the cars, but if...

436
00:29:49,315 --> 00:29:51,298
if I did what they said,

437
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:56,938
that we'd be safe, we'd get to go home.

438
00:29:57,866 --> 00:30:00,129
Okay. How?

439
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:04,844
How would we get to go home?

440
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,660
- I don't know.
- Okay.

441
00:30:11,665 --> 00:30:15,891
Do you still believe that
they were telling the truth?

442
00:30:15,896 --> 00:30:20,798
They promised... that
Nathan would be okay.

443
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:25,555
They-they promised, and now, now he's...

444
00:30:28,014 --> 00:30:29,165
Sara.

445
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,954
Sara, listen to me. Come here.

446
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:33,004
Listen to me. Listen to me, Sara.

447
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,419
If these voices are real,

448
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:37,743
if something here is
communicating with you,

449
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:39,213
then that means you're
connected to this place

450
00:30:39,217 --> 00:30:40,954
in a way that no one else here is,

451
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:43,649
and that makes you incredibly valuable.

452
00:30:43,654 --> 00:30:45,024
Do you understand?

453
00:30:45,317 --> 00:30:47,276
But we need proof.

454
00:30:47,766 --> 00:30:49,665
We need to be able to go to Sheriff Boyd

455
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,959
and tell him with absolute
certainty that you...

456
00:30:52,964 --> 00:30:54,182
That I'm not crazy.

457
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:57,196
No, the voices, that
these voices are not simply

458
00:30:57,201 --> 00:30:58,986
the product of a troubled mind.

459
00:30:59,506 --> 00:31:01,727
So, Sara, I need...

460
00:31:01,732 --> 00:31:02,732
Ow!

461
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,087
- Sara?
- Ow.

462
00:31:04,092 --> 00:31:05,493
- What?
- Ow. No!

463
00:31:05,498 --> 00:31:07,587
What?

464
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,149
- Sara.
- No! No!

465
00:31:10,154 --> 00:31:12,204
- What?
- No, no, no!

466
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:15,212
- What?
- Please! Ah, no, no!

467
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:16,461
What?

468
00:31:16,466 --> 00:31:18,157
- Sara, what is it?
- Ah, no!

469
00:31:18,162 --> 00:31:21,493
- What?
- I need... I need...

470
00:31:21,842 --> 00:31:24,688
- Need what?
- Paper.

471
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:26,352
Paper.

472
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:32,025
They want me to show you something.

473
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:12,986
Hello? Is anybody out there?

474
00:32:17,128 --> 00:32:18,735
Hello?

475
00:32:21,658 --> 00:32:22,877
Is anybody there?

476
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,610
I don't want any tea!

477
00:32:50,772 --> 00:32:52,904
You realize I have no
idea what you're saying.

478
00:32:56,513 --> 00:32:57,862
Fine.

479
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:07,396
It's good.

480
00:33:08,105 --> 00:33:09,629
Thanks.

481
00:33:15,926 --> 00:33:18,766
I keep seeing it. I-I keep...

482
00:33:19,943 --> 00:33:23,344
I keep having these, uh...

483
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:28,898
Hey, where are you going?

484
00:33:32,752 --> 00:33:34,232
Hello?

485
00:33:35,302 --> 00:33:36,433
Where'd you go?

486
00:33:46,535 --> 00:33:49,320
Holy shit.

487
00:33:50,303 --> 00:33:52,298
This is all the, uh...

488
00:33:52,311 --> 00:33:54,574
Wow. Oh, wait, wait! Hold on.

489
00:33:54,756 --> 00:33:56,367
Slow down, Tian. I got this.

490
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,790
What...

491
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:05,579
What are you looking for?

492
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,071
What is that? It's a yearbook.

493
00:34:12,076 --> 00:34:15,626
1972? How many people...?

494
00:34:18,814 --> 00:34:20,337
Okay.

495
00:34:21,063 --> 00:34:23,999
Well, I mean, could you tell
me what you're looking for?

496
00:34:24,004 --> 00:34:25,876
Shh.

497
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,125
What's that?

498
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:35,699
Hmm?

499
00:34:53,693 --> 00:34:55,649
Oh, what the fuck?

500
00:35:10,711 --> 00:35:12,102
Please...

501
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:14,462
I can't...

502
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:36,430
I don't...

503
00:35:37,181 --> 00:35:38,790
What is this?

504
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:40,282
They said...

505
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:46,636
They said they watched you
on the day you got here.

506
00:35:47,587 --> 00:35:50,048
They said they watched you bury the bag

507
00:35:50,053 --> 00:35:53,141
and that this is proof
that they're real.

508
00:35:57,877 --> 00:36:00,001
Do you know what that means?

509
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:18,542
Oh!

510
00:36:23,942 --> 00:36:25,868
Ah! Here we go.

511
00:36:29,435 --> 00:36:30,827
Yeah.

512
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:34,454
That's it. There we go.

513
00:36:36,932 --> 00:36:37,932
Hey.

514
00:36:43,275 --> 00:36:44,276
Ladies.

515
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,704
Fuck!

516
00:36:55,061 --> 00:36:56,106
Come in.

517
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:58,511
Hey.

518
00:37:04,465 --> 00:37:08,469
I was, uh, going through my
things back at the station,

519
00:37:08,474 --> 00:37:12,048
and I realized I haven't
thrown a ball around in a while.

520
00:37:12,585 --> 00:37:14,071
Come on outside.

521
00:37:14,076 --> 00:37:16,493
You can help an old
man knock the rust off.

522
00:37:16,498 --> 00:37:18,326
I'm good.

523
00:37:21,685 --> 00:37:23,798
Hey, I ever tell you, uh,

524
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:26,476
I played first base back in college.

525
00:37:26,857 --> 00:37:28,196
No.

526
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:29,724
Yeah, I was pretty good too.

527
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,344
Had a couple scouts kicking around.

528
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:35,274
Here I am, 18 years old, thinkin',

529
00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:37,673
"Man, I might be going to the show,"

530
00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:40,649
"be the next Willie McCovey."

531
00:37:42,266 --> 00:37:44,051
What happened?

532
00:37:45,655 --> 00:37:48,813
Oh, you know...

533
00:37:50,198 --> 00:37:51,983
life had other plans.

534
00:37:55,372 --> 00:37:58,027
Life always seems to have other plans.

535
00:38:06,465 --> 00:38:07,771
I'm sick, Kenny.

536
00:38:11,892 --> 00:38:13,328
What do you...?

537
00:38:13,983 --> 00:38:16,165
Have you talked to Kristi about it?

538
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,008
Not that kind of sick.

539
00:38:19,248 --> 00:38:21,424
My father was diagnosed with Parkinson's

540
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:23,368
when he was around my age.

541
00:38:23,373 --> 00:38:25,723
It's not supposed to be hereditary.

542
00:38:25,728 --> 00:38:27,368
The doctors all swore up and down

543
00:38:27,373 --> 00:38:30,289
how extremely rare that would be.

544
00:38:30,294 --> 00:38:32,837
Wrong time to win the lottery, I guess.

545
00:38:33,683 --> 00:38:37,352
But how do you know
that...? How do you know?

546
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:39,407
I mean, it could be anything, right?

547
00:38:39,412 --> 00:38:40,674
It is what it is.

548
00:38:42,435 --> 00:38:44,321
Look...

549
00:38:45,774 --> 00:38:48,516
this thing is already
chipping away at me.

550
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,883
And eventually, I'm gonna get
to the point where I can't...

551
00:38:52,888 --> 00:38:57,850
I'm not gonna be able to
protect these people anymore.

552
00:38:58,346 --> 00:39:02,437
So I gotta find us a way
out while I still can.

553
00:39:02,701 --> 00:39:04,313
You understand?

554
00:39:04,715 --> 00:39:07,102
The only way I can do this

555
00:39:07,107 --> 00:39:10,212
is because I know these people
are gonna be in good hands

556
00:39:10,217 --> 00:39:11,740
when I'm gone.

557
00:39:13,966 --> 00:39:15,415
There's a lot of folks in this town

558
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,511
who are alive today because of you.

559
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,360
And I know your dad
isn't around to say it,

560
00:39:23,365 --> 00:39:25,282
but I promise you...

561
00:39:26,122 --> 00:39:28,415
he's so goddamn proud of you.

562
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,198
I'm proud of you.

563
00:39:32,297 --> 00:39:34,618
But if you tell me right now

564
00:39:34,861 --> 00:39:37,167
that you are not ready for me to go,

565
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,688
that you need more time,

566
00:39:41,766 --> 00:39:43,942
then I ain't going nowhere.

567
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,094
Okay?

568
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:04,635
Well, we doing this or what?

569
00:40:06,646 --> 00:40:08,474
Doing it.

570
00:40:11,747 --> 00:40:14,704
Hey? Anybody here?

571
00:40:16,005 --> 00:40:18,462
We might be onto
something with this radio.

572
00:40:18,652 --> 00:40:21,290
We're gonna have to get it
higher up, but it could...

573
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:26,243
What the fuck?

574
00:40:30,164 --> 00:40:31,320
Hi, Dad.

575
00:40:31,325 --> 00:40:32,500
Hey, kiddo.

576
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:33,710
What you up to?

577
00:40:33,715 --> 00:40:35,493
We're on an adventure.

578
00:40:35,498 --> 00:40:36,641
There's a lot of dirt,

579
00:40:36,646 --> 00:40:38,782
so mom said I should bring some outside.

580
00:40:38,787 --> 00:40:40,852
Uh-huh. And where is your mother?

581
00:40:40,857 --> 00:40:42,633
In the basement.

582
00:41:04,993 --> 00:41:06,386
Tabitha?

583
00:41:06,603 --> 00:41:09,911
Hey. Hey. How'd things go?

584
00:41:10,441 --> 00:41:11,572
Good.

585
00:41:11,577 --> 00:41:12,752
Yeah?

586
00:41:12,757 --> 00:41:14,587
We got some static, so...

587
00:41:14,592 --> 00:41:16,219
Yeah, well, that's wonderful, right?

588
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:17,921
Yeah, it's a start.

589
00:41:18,526 --> 00:41:20,179
What you doing?

590
00:41:20,184 --> 00:41:21,968
It's like you said this morning,

591
00:41:21,973 --> 00:41:25,324
it has to come from somewhere,
right? The electricity.

592
00:41:25,669 --> 00:41:28,610
There's no power lines,
and all the wires,

593
00:41:28,615 --> 00:41:30,225
all the cords, they just...

594
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:33,059
they just go down, straight down.

595
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,610
It's so weird.

596
00:41:37,308 --> 00:41:39,532
Okay. Uh, sorry, can you...

597
00:41:39,537 --> 00:41:41,322
not dig for a moment?

598
00:41:42,217 --> 00:41:43,217
Yes.

599
00:41:46,084 --> 00:41:47,477
What's going on?

600
00:41:49,146 --> 00:41:50,977
Okay.

601
00:41:52,417 --> 00:41:54,637
Do you remember the bracelet I made you?

602
00:41:56,345 --> 00:41:57,501
The what?

603
00:41:57,506 --> 00:42:00,594
The bracelet I made you
after our first few dates,

604
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:02,446
from, uh, the laces
of your father's boots.

605
00:42:02,451 --> 00:42:04,118
Yeah, of course, I remember.

606
00:42:04,123 --> 00:42:05,243
Okay. Remember,

607
00:42:05,248 --> 00:42:08,033
you lost it at the hospital
the night Julie was born.

608
00:42:08,046 --> 00:42:09,610
Okay.

609
00:42:10,556 --> 00:42:12,969
Turn around. Look what's sitting there.

610
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:28,203
Okay, I still don't get it.

611
00:42:29,068 --> 00:42:30,314
You're saying you found a bracelet

612
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:31,330
that's similar to the one you gave...

613
00:42:31,334 --> 00:42:32,852
No, no, no, no. It's not similar.

614
00:42:32,857 --> 00:42:35,118
That is the bracelet.
Those are the laces

615
00:42:35,123 --> 00:42:36,123
from your father's boots!

616
00:42:36,128 --> 00:42:38,522
No, those were generic rawhide laces,

617
00:42:38,527 --> 00:42:40,572
the same you'd find on any boot.

618
00:42:40,577 --> 00:42:43,406
No, no, no, no, no,
no. Look. Look at this.

619
00:42:44,015 --> 00:42:45,696
- Look at this.
- What?

620
00:42:45,701 --> 00:42:49,008
This was an accident. I made this.

621
00:42:49,408 --> 00:42:51,976
I was so afraid I ruined it,
but then, when I gave it to you,

622
00:42:51,981 --> 00:42:53,947
- you said, "Accidents..."
- "Accidents are the best part."

623
00:42:53,951 --> 00:42:55,692
Yes. Why?

624
00:42:55,697 --> 00:42:58,015
Ah, because it makes it one of a kind.

625
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,500
Exactly.

626
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:05,790
It's impossible.

627
00:43:05,813 --> 00:43:08,868
Jim, everything about
this is impossible.

628
00:43:09,428 --> 00:43:10,821
That doesn't make any sense.

629
00:43:10,826 --> 00:43:12,969
Those wires don't make sense.

630
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:15,939
We may not be able to
find out how this got here,

631
00:43:15,944 --> 00:43:19,415
but we can find out
where those wires go.

632
00:43:22,138 --> 00:43:23,661
Give me the shovel.

633
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,235
Where's yours?

634
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,102
First base. I don't need no glove.

635
00:44:47,334 --> 00:44:49,251
Are you sure? Because I got some heat.

636
00:44:49,256 --> 00:44:51,016
Just throw the damn ball.

637
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,610
You're gonna regret this.

638
00:44:52,615 --> 00:44:54,735
I hear a lot of talking, but I'm not...

639
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,079
Here comes the heat.

640
00:45:00,963 --> 00:45:06,212
I think, uh... think
maybe I'll carve us a bat.

641
00:45:06,978 --> 00:45:09,962
That way, when you get
back, we can do this right.

642
00:45:10,402 --> 00:45:12,534
When I get back, huh?

643
00:45:13,597 --> 00:45:15,773
Yeah, when you get back.

644
00:45:27,369 --> 00:45:28,943
Yeah.

645
00:46:49,533 --> 00:46:52,025
They're so beautiful.

646
00:46:53,851 --> 00:46:55,729
I'm so glad you like them.

647
00:46:57,392 --> 00:46:59,674
When can I come inside?

648
00:47:00,513 --> 00:47:03,513
