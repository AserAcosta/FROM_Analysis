00:00:11,137 --> 00:00:12,343
Meagan, what are you doing?

3
00:00:12,348 --> 00:00:14,257
Maybe I can come in.

4
00:00:15,096 --> 00:00:16,257
Meagan, no!

5
00:00:19,188 --> 00:00:20,972
A man protects his family, Frank!

6
00:00:20,977 --> 00:00:22,761
Open your eyes and look!

7
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:24,154
No!

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,468
"Norman, you're gonna be okay."

9
00:00:26,473 --> 00:00:29,359
"Tell my parents I said... goodbye."

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,218
Sorry, buddy, Norman's dead.

11
00:00:32,223 --> 00:00:34,382
Mom! Julie killed Norman.

12
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:35,734
What happened to Norman?

13
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:37,492
The monsters killed them.

14
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:39,368
There's no such thing
as monsters, honey.

15
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,514
Why is there a tree in
the middle of the road?

16
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:43,559
Must've gotten knocked down
in a storm or something.

17
00:00:45,528 --> 00:00:48,062
Sorry to interrupt your
service. I was wondering

18
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:49,766
if you could point me in
the direction of the highway.

19
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,133
Yeah, you just keep on following
the road right up that hill,

20
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:54,429
right where you were
going and you'll see.

21
00:00:54,717 --> 00:00:58,148
How is this possible? We're
on the same fucking road!

22
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:04,409
Tabby?

23
00:01:04,414 --> 00:01:05,500
Dad, I think he's bleeding!

24
00:01:05,505 --> 00:01:07,148
There's something in his leg!

25
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:17,990
Hey! We need help!

26
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,742
You just rest. I'll be back soon.

27
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:23,991
Look at the mess he made.

28
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:25,737
Well, that's not exactly his fault.

29
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:27,963
I don't like.

30
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:29,398
Let's get you downstairs.

31
00:01:29,403 --> 00:01:32,851
Can you stitch the kid up inside the RV?

32
00:01:33,881 --> 00:01:35,531
It'll work.

33
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,421
- You know this is suicide.
- Just take care of the family.

34
00:01:38,426 --> 00:01:40,266
Run as fast as you can!
No matter what you see,

35
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,401
no matter what you hear,

36
00:01:41,406 --> 00:01:43,576
- you do not stop!
- This isn't your fault.

37
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:45,492
What do you mean?

38
00:01:46,878 --> 00:01:48,097
Hold his neck!

39
00:01:48,102 --> 00:01:49,594
- Yeah, you're doing great.
- Ethan, Ethan...

40
00:01:49,598 --> 00:01:50,991
Good, good, good, good.

41
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:53,195
Shit.

42
00:01:54,026 --> 00:01:55,811
Kristi?

43
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:57,765
They're comin'.

Hands under the neck!
Under the neck! Good.

46
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,195
- Why won't it stop?
- Kristi?

47
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,721
- We're good, we're good.
- Ethan, come on.

48
00:04:49,725 --> 00:04:52,045
We're doing good.
Keep the airway open like that.

49
00:04:58,161 --> 00:04:59,685
Okay. Ethan?

50
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,955
Ethan?

51
00:05:02,173 --> 00:05:03,653
Ethan?

52
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:07,259
He's breathing. He's stable. Okay?

53
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:09,919
He has a pulse.
You're okay. You're okay.

54
00:05:16,353 --> 00:05:18,051
Is everyone okay in there?

55
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:19,832
They're back.

56
00:05:19,837 --> 00:05:21,849
No. Wait.

57
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,246
They came back for us.

58
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:26,543
Are you going to let 'em in?

59
00:05:26,548 --> 00:05:27,849
No.

60
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:29,517
Why are we waiting?

61
00:05:29,654 --> 00:05:31,504
I'm not letting 'em in!

62
00:05:33,283 --> 00:05:34,501
I'm gonna help 'em in, then.

63
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:35,583
Jim, no!

64
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:37,517
Jim, look... stop! Oh, hey! Jim, Jim!

65
00:05:37,522 --> 00:05:39,762
Back off! I need you... I need you to...

66
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:41,416
Take it... take it easy.
All right, buddy.

67
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:43,468
All right. All right, buddy.

68
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:46,520
They are not people and they
are not here to help, Jim!

69
00:05:47,384 --> 00:05:48,424
Let me go, man.

70
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:50,387
Okay. You good?

71
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,950
Let me go.

72
00:05:51,955 --> 00:05:53,260
Fucking fuck!

73
00:05:53,512 --> 00:05:54,512
All right.

74
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:03,595
Can you see it? You see it?

75
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,927
It's right up there,
come on. We're good.

76
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,783
- Come on! Go, go!
- Come on. Let's go.

77
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:09,973
- Wait, where's my mom? Mom!
- Come on! Let's go.

78
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:11,579
We're almost there! Keep moving!

79
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:13,324
- Come on!
- Don't stop! Go, go, go!

80
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:15,321
- Hey! Hey!
- Watch out!

81
00:06:15,326 --> 00:06:17,367
Watch your step here!
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

82
00:06:17,372 --> 00:06:18,460
Fuck! Pick him up!

83
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:20,413
Are you okay? Hey, I need help here!

84
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:22,072
- No, no!
- Should we go back?

85
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:24,199
Kenny, take them! Kenny,
You gotta take them!

86
00:06:24,204 --> 00:06:26,511
Go, go, go! Don't stop. Don't look!

87
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:28,345
- Come on!
- No, no, no, no!

88
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,482
You've gotta get
up! You've gotta get up!

89
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:31,734
You've gotta get up!

90
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:33,001
Come on!

91
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:34,931
Motherfucker, come on!

92
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:37,447
You can't stop.

93
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,928
Runners on the hill! We
got runners on the hill!

94
00:06:53,243 --> 00:06:55,018
Runners on the hill!

95
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,459
- Go, go, go!
- Who's in there?

96
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:02,324
- Don't look back! Go!
- Why are we...

97
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:04,157
Come on! Go! Go!

98
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:10,646
What are you doing?! Open the door!

99
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,730
Those aren't our people!

100
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:13,386
Ellis is out there!
What's wrong with you?!

101
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,262
I can't. No! I said no!

102
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:18,095
Straight to the door! Come on!

103
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,956
- Open the door!
- Hello?!

104
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:21,213
- Hey! Open the door!
- We need help!

105
00:07:21,217 --> 00:07:22,845
Hey! Hey!

106
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,517
What's going on? Why
won't they open the door?!

107
00:07:25,522 --> 00:07:26,800
Donna, let us in!

108
00:07:27,285 --> 00:07:28,873
We have people out here! Open the door!

109
00:07:28,878 --> 00:07:31,054
- Donna, let us in!
- Do you hear that?

110
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:35,356
What are you doing? Let us in!

111
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:37,322
Put the gun down and open the door!

112
00:07:37,327 --> 00:07:39,149
You said not to let anybody in here.

113
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:41,934
- Never open the door after dark.
- I know you're scared,

114
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:44,173
but are you really gonna
let those people die?

115
00:07:44,178 --> 00:07:47,439
Donna, hey! Open the fucking door!

116
00:07:50,485 --> 00:07:52,501
- Julie.
- Hey! What are you doing?!

117
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,267
Don't you recognize me?

118
00:07:57,503 --> 00:07:58,547
Oh, my God!

119
00:07:58,552 --> 00:08:00,997
- Go inside!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

120
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:06,220
- You, on the floor.
- What?

121
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:09,174
- On the floor now!
- No, no, no, no.

122
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:11,355
You don't have to get down! No!

123
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,570
You shut your mouth! I said,
get on the goddamn floor!

124
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:15,185
- Why?
- Just do what she says.

125
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,230
- Now!
- It's okay.

126
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:17,453
Tie them up.

127
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:18,971
Hey, Donna, come on.

128
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:20,500
We have a protocol.

129
00:08:23,998 --> 00:08:26,236
Ellis, just come on.

130
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:28,415
Okay.

131
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:30,431
Why are you doing this?

132
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:33,018
We're not gonna do anything!

133
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:34,992
Please?

134
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:36,467
Mom...

135
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:38,840
It's okay. It's okay.

136
00:08:38,845 --> 00:08:40,672
I'm here, I'm here. It's okay, baby.

137
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,755
Are they gone?

138
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:49,006
Hard to tell.

139
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,064
You okay? Hey, Jim?

140
00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:55,312
Hey, you still with us?

141
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:57,290
Yeah.

142
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,395
You said...

143
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,259
You said they aren't people.

144
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,408
That's right.

145
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:07,564
Then what are they?

146
00:09:08,977 --> 00:09:10,103
Well, we don't know.

147
00:09:11,462 --> 00:09:13,283
Look,

148
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:17,682
these talismans, they're what
protect the houses in town.

149
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:22,034
I don't know why it works,
but you got one of those,

150
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,684
you keep the doors and windows
shut; they can't get in.

151
00:09:25,423 --> 00:09:27,300
Never tried it on a vehicle.

152
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:28,756
This is impossible.

153
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:31,439
Yeah, it is.

154
00:09:33,832 --> 00:09:35,703
Has he had seizures like this before?

155
00:09:36,111 --> 00:09:38,055
No, never.

156
00:09:41,026 --> 00:09:42,582
What? What does that mean?

157
00:09:42,587 --> 00:09:44,129
Nothing. It doesn't mean anything yet.

158
00:09:44,134 --> 00:09:45,785
It could mean a number of things,

159
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,760
trauma from the accident, but right now,

160
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:49,845
we need to focus on getting
this out of his leg so...

161
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:50,981
Dad?

162
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:52,981
Hey.

163
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:56,460
Ah, I know.

164
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:58,876
I'm right here. I'm right here. Hey.

165
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,900
Okay, sweets, we're just gonna
give you a little poke, okay?

166
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:03,080
What is that?

167
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:05,025
It's a sedative, just
to help keep him calm.

168
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,383
Okay.

169
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:08,571
Okay. All right. Hey, look at me.

170
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:10,002
Look at me. No, you
don't need to see that.

171
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:11,867
That's it. Look at me, look at me.

172
00:10:13,263 --> 00:10:14,526
- That's it, that's it.
- All done!

173
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,009
There, look at you. All done.

174
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,308
Yeah, yeah. It's okay.

175
00:10:18,313 --> 00:10:20,751
- Alright?
- Yeah. That's it. That's it.

176
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:28,814
Is he from the RV?

177
00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:31,147
No. He's from another car.

178
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:32,936
There was an accident outside of town.

179
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:36,462
So, there were two cars?
Never seen that before.

180
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:39,079
Yeah. Neither have I.

181
00:10:44,038 --> 00:10:45,387
That's a nice watch.

182
00:10:45,392 --> 00:10:46,641
Hey. Just leave it alone.

183
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,658
Why? It's not like it's
gonna do him any good here.

184
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:51,837
Yeah. It's not gonna do
anything for you either.

185
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:54,431
But it's pretty.

186
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,607
So is he.

187
00:10:56,737 --> 00:11:00,764
I mean, even with the
blood and everything,

188
00:11:01,238 --> 00:11:03,084
he's very handsome.

189
00:11:03,258 --> 00:11:05,782
Don't touch anything, okay?

190
00:11:06,178 --> 00:11:07,350
Fine.

191
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:10,686
I'm just gonna stay and look
at him for a little while.

192
00:11:18,237 --> 00:11:19,281
Where's my daughter?

193
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:21,114
She's good. She's fine.

194
00:11:21,283 --> 00:11:23,155
Listen, sorry about
what happened down there,

195
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,920
but it was necessary.
You'll understand that soon.

196
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:27,162
I need to see Julie!

197
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:28,465
She's good. She's fine.

198
00:11:28,923 --> 00:11:30,298
You need some water.

199
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:34,821
Here.

200
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,829
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Whoa, whoa... stop!

201
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:41,217
- Julie!
- Hey! Hey!

202
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:42,653
- Julie!
- Stop!

203
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:43,964
- Sit!
- Ow!

204
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,221
Sit!

205
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,568
Watch her.

206
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:53,190
Okay.

207
00:11:54,953 --> 00:11:56,171
Listen.

208
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:01,590
I know none of this makes sense yet,

209
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,634
but these are precautions
we have to take.

210
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,943
We don't know you,

211
00:12:04,948 --> 00:12:07,547
and everyone reacts differently
on their first night.

212
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:10,720
But I promise you, there
is not a single person here

213
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:12,814
who wants to hurt you or your daughter.

214
00:12:13,342 --> 00:12:15,551
Everyone in this house,

215
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:19,699
everyone in this town has been
exactly where you are right now.

216
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:22,972
I need to see my daughter!

217
00:12:22,977 --> 00:12:24,566
And you will.

218
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,616
But first, we have to talk.

219
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:31,121
There are things you need
to know about where you are,

220
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,113
about the way things are now.

221
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:36,292
This, unfortunately,

222
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,801
is gonna be the worst
conversation of your life.

223
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:45,121
Do you believe in monsters?

224
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:55,375
Hello.

225
00:12:59,729 --> 00:13:01,688
I'm gonna take some peaches.

226
00:13:02,341 --> 00:13:03,734
You mind?

227
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:15,042
Yeah, I'm not supposed to take these.

228
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:17,180
But-but Donna, she...

229
00:13:17,185 --> 00:13:19,074
She looks the other way sometimes,

230
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:23,636
and we all get a little wiggle
room on one or two things.

231
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:26,356
I was gonna open them in my room,

232
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,145
but I'll open 'em
here, if you want some.

233
00:13:33,482 --> 00:13:35,848
You're from one of those two cars, huh?

234
00:13:36,114 --> 00:13:40,118
That hasn't happened
in a long, long time.

235
00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:42,599
It's special.

236
00:13:48,418 --> 00:13:50,090
What do you think it means?

237
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,121
Please don't...

238
00:13:51,126 --> 00:13:53,604
Victor! What are you doing?

239
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,221
Leave that poor girl alone.

240
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,397
We were having a conversation.

241
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:00,957
You're scaring her. You know the rules.

242
00:14:00,962 --> 00:14:02,785
Now, take your peaches and shoo.

243
00:14:05,188 --> 00:14:06,188
Hm.

244
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:09,699
Sorry about that.

245
00:14:09,704 --> 00:14:11,454
He's creepy, but he's harmless.

246
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,635
He's just been here a really long time.

247
00:14:14,364 --> 00:14:17,137
I'm Fatima. I'm gonna be your proxy.

248
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:19,332
My what?

249
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:23,121
It's just a fancy way of saying
I'm here to keep you company.

250
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:27,152
Sorry about the...

251
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,812
Sometimes people freak
out a bit the first night.

252
00:14:29,947 --> 00:14:31,566
It's scary, and it's weird,

253
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,573
and it's just sometimes
too much, you know?

254
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,230
We just don't want anyone getting hurt.

255
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:37,657
Really?

256
00:14:37,662 --> 00:14:40,035
Is that why those guys
pointed guns at us?

257
00:14:40,824 --> 00:14:42,877
They shouldn't have done that.

258
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:46,512
Look, everybody here is
just doing the best they can.

259
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:49,160
You really gotta focus
on the good things here.

260
00:15:00,073 --> 00:15:04,207
If I untie you, do you promise
not to do anything crazy?

261
00:15:04,744 --> 00:15:06,746
There's something I'd
really like to show you.

262
00:15:09,512 --> 00:15:10,600
Okay.

263
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:11,988
Okay.

264
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:25,446
Who did all this?

265
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:29,035
Ellis. He's really talented.

266
00:15:30,488 --> 00:15:32,491
I bet he'd love to draw you.

267
00:15:33,488 --> 00:15:34,754
Why?

268
00:15:35,113 --> 00:15:36,879
'Cause you're beautiful.

269
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:39,242
That's not funny.

270
00:15:39,247 --> 00:15:41,801
I wasn't being funny.

271
00:15:44,347 --> 00:15:45,965
Come on.

272
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:49,121
We have to keep all the
windows covered at night.

273
00:15:49,126 --> 00:15:51,934
It's harder for them to trick
you if you can't see them.

274
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,140
Who?

275
00:15:54,145 --> 00:15:56,346
Those things out there.

276
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:59,090
They whisper, try to get in your head.

277
00:15:59,355 --> 00:16:01,441
It said your name, right?

278
00:16:01,446 --> 00:16:04,699
Sometimes they convince
people to let them in and...

279
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:07,575
Well...

280
00:16:07,831 --> 00:16:09,659
Here. Come here.

281
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:11,934
Just don't... Don't look down.

282
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:14,190
Just look out.

283
00:16:24,593 --> 00:16:26,247
Why did you bring me here?

284
00:16:27,348 --> 00:16:29,504
'Cause I wanted you to see...

285
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:32,643
that if you climb high enough,

286
00:16:33,204 --> 00:16:35,424
even a nightmare can look like a dream.

287
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:45,120
Okay, good. Pulse is strong;

288
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,007
his breathing's really good.
I think we're good to go.

289
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:51,996
You really should've
let us help you.

290
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,902
What happens if they get in?

291
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:04,527
Jim...

292
00:17:04,715 --> 00:17:07,799
What... happens if they get in?

293
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:12,061
You have a gun.

294
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:13,380
Why don't you use it?

295
00:17:13,385 --> 00:17:14,770
'Cause it won't do any good!

296
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:16,639
You... you just gotta trust me.

297
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:17,939
I don't know you.

298
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:29,168
Well, there has to be
something we can do.

299
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:31,441
Jim, Jim, Jim! Hey! Jim! Jim, Jim, Jim!

300
00:17:31,446 --> 00:17:33,387
Hey, we just have to wait it out, okay?

301
00:17:33,392 --> 00:17:34,929
With the talisman in the window,

302
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:37,480
the only way they can get
in here is if we let 'em in.

303
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:40,576
So, come on, just...

304
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:42,293
Come on.

305
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,535
Is that door secure?

306
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,140
It's not gonna open. Just, just...

307
00:17:51,145 --> 00:17:52,676
The talisman, what
if it... what if it...

308
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,024
- What if it falls?
- Kristi!

309
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:55,664
- What if it falls?
- Kristi! Hey! Hey, hey!

310
00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:58,338
It's not gonna fall. This
is what they do, right?

311
00:17:58,467 --> 00:17:59,552
Try to rattle you.

312
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:00,691
Get in your head.

313
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:04,285
Make you do something
stupid. You know that, right?

314
00:18:14,034 --> 00:18:15,296
They're on the roof.

315
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,006
Okay, listen to me, kiddo.

316
00:18:20,222 --> 00:18:22,760
Listen, hey, breathe with me. Breathe.

317
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:25,879
Okay. Let's forget about what's outside.

318
00:18:25,884 --> 00:18:28,582
Let's just think about what's in here.

319
00:18:30,363 --> 00:18:32,152
Focus on him.

320
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:34,025
Okay?

321
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,463
You got this, kiddo. You got it.

322
00:18:36,468 --> 00:18:38,793
You got this, right?

323
00:18:39,246 --> 00:18:41,301
We focus on Ethan.

324
00:18:41,363 --> 00:18:45,762
We all stay calm. You
tell us what we need to do.

325
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:47,559
Kenny!

326
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:50,480
It's not right, tying 'em
up like fuckin' animals.

327
00:18:51,124 --> 00:18:53,241
They must be scared out of their minds!

328
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:54,888
They have their own way
of doing things here.

329
00:18:54,892 --> 00:18:56,565
Yeah. It's a fucked-up way.

330
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,485
Isn't it?

331
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:00,579
Hey.

332
00:19:01,664 --> 00:19:04,268
There's a room made up
for you on the third floor.

333
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:06,797
Just let the guys know when
you're ready to call it a night.

334
00:19:06,928 --> 00:19:08,934
What? You're not gonna tie us up first?

335
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:11,754
Thank you, Ellis.

336
00:19:12,098 --> 00:19:14,441
Uh, the man we helped carry in, is he...

337
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:17,176
Ah, yeah, no, that guy,
uh, yeah, he's still out.

338
00:19:17,181 --> 00:19:19,216
I mean, I don't know what
kind of drugs that guy was on,

339
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,730
but he's gonna have a hell
of a time when he wakes up.

340
00:19:24,715 --> 00:19:27,204
Look, man, I know, uh...

341
00:19:27,574 --> 00:19:29,684
I know Donna can be
a little, you know...

342
00:19:30,673 --> 00:19:32,943
but they opened the door, though, right?

343
00:19:32,948 --> 00:19:36,051
Eventually.

344
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:37,621
Yeah, well, all I'm saying is

345
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:39,566
tonight could've been a whole lot worse.

346
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:41,833
I mean, if you didn't leave
the fuckin' spike strip down...

347
00:19:41,837 --> 00:19:43,708
Hey, hey, come on!

348
00:19:43,713 --> 00:19:45,449
Are you fucking kidding right now?

349
00:19:45,923 --> 00:19:47,795
Enough.

350
00:19:50,886 --> 00:19:54,207
Look, it's been a long night, okay?

351
00:19:54,212 --> 00:19:55,343
Yeah.

352
00:19:55,581 --> 00:19:56,630
Come on.

353
00:19:56,635 --> 00:19:58,419
Yeah. Yeah.

354
00:20:02,324 --> 00:20:03,413
Just in case

355
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:05,726
you could use a little
something to take the edge off.

356
00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:07,879
It's a kind gesture.

357
00:20:09,556 --> 00:20:11,166
Yeah, whatever.

358
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:13,285
It's there for you if you want it.

359
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,699
See you in the morning.

360
00:20:17,737 --> 00:20:19,043
Sit.

361
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,270
Okay, I guess I'm not
that great at chess.

362
00:20:40,465 --> 00:20:41,800
You good.

363
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,723
Just... better.

364
00:20:44,728 --> 00:20:46,277
Yeah, you're okay.

365
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,473
When I come America,

366
00:20:51,478 --> 00:20:55,786
I not speak English, but I play.

367
00:20:56,298 --> 00:21:01,085
This, uh... people speak same.

368
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:03,044
Like a universal language?

369
00:21:03,174 --> 00:21:05,002
And you taught Kenny.

370
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:06,949
That's nice.

371
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,028
Fu-Hen.

372
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,129
What?

373
00:21:12,244 --> 00:21:14,730
His name: Fu-Hen.

374
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:18,027
He want to be America.

375
00:21:18,032 --> 00:21:21,808
He want America name.

376
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:33,640
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

377
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:36,910
I want my son!

378
00:21:37,334 --> 00:21:38,988
It's okay. He went home for the night.

379
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:41,152
He'll be back tomorrow.
Come on. Let's go.

380
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:43,035
It's okay.

381
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,864
Try to remember where you are. Okay.

382
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:48,545
Okay. We're gonna do a nice clean pull.

383
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,433
Nice and slow. Now,
it's gonna hurt a lot.

384
00:21:51,438 --> 00:21:54,214
- Yeah.
- So we need him as still as possible.

385
00:21:54,219 --> 00:21:55,816
Boyd, hold on to his legs,

386
00:21:55,821 --> 00:21:57,871
and you can hold his neck area. Okay?

387
00:21:57,876 --> 00:21:59,816
Uh-huh. Okay.

388
00:22:01,897 --> 00:22:03,194
Ready?

389
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:04,453
Mm-hmm.

390
00:22:04,474 --> 00:22:05,605
Here we go.

391
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:11,738
Okay.

392
00:22:11,928 --> 00:22:13,065
All right.

393
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,067
Ah! That's all right.

394
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:16,374
- That's all right!
- Please stop!

395
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,636
- It hurts! Ow!
- All right, all right!

396
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:19,641
That's it!

397
00:22:19,646 --> 00:22:21,286
Okay. Good. Hold him still!

398
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,856
- Daddy!
- Got it, got it, got it.

399
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,730
- Yeah, that's okay.
- Stop! Ow!

400
00:22:25,735 --> 00:22:26,925
That's okay.

401
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,821
Just hold on, hold on, hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on now.

402
00:22:32,574 --> 00:22:33,699
Got it! Got it. Okay.

403
00:22:33,704 --> 00:22:35,349
All right. Boyd, put pressure.

404
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,746
Put pressure got it, yeah.

405
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:38,539
You did great. You did so good.

406
00:22:38,544 --> 00:22:39,777
You did great.

407
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,269
We're gonna patch you up, okay?

408
00:22:42,508 --> 00:22:43,847
Good, good, okay.

409
00:22:43,852 --> 00:22:46,880
- Kristi? Hey, hey.
- Okay.

410
00:22:46,885 --> 00:22:48,152
Breathe.

411
00:22:48,163 --> 00:22:50,799
Okay. Okay, you did great.

412
00:22:51,052 --> 00:22:52,053
Here we go.

413
00:22:53,023 --> 00:22:54,629
Just gonna stitch him up.

414
00:23:04,924 --> 00:23:06,691
I don't want to.

415
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:18,013
I can't.

416
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,599
I can't do any more.

417
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:26,989
Are you sure?

418
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,411
Okay.

419
00:23:36,661 --> 00:23:39,195
I'm so sorry.

420
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:06,706
How?

421
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:35,604
All of it?

422
00:24:51,084 --> 00:24:53,347
My mom's... my mom's
probably worried sick.

423
00:24:53,946 --> 00:24:55,643
She'll be fine.

424
00:24:57,897 --> 00:25:00,972
So I, uh, stopped by
the clinic the other day.

425
00:25:00,977 --> 00:25:02,283
Yeah? Let me guess,

426
00:25:02,288 --> 00:25:05,239
my dad try to rope you
into a game of chess.

427
00:25:05,244 --> 00:25:06,593
Ah, he did.

428
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:13,778
Even when it gets bad, um,
you show him a chessboard

429
00:25:13,783 --> 00:25:16,220
and he doesn't always
remember how the pieces work,

430
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:18,044
but he does remember the game.

431
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:20,949
You know, he used to make me

432
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:25,340
play for hours when I
was a kid, and I hated it.

433
00:25:25,345 --> 00:25:26,955
Really?

434
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,265
Now I, um...

435
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:35,138
Uh, anyway, Kristi,

436
00:25:35,143 --> 00:25:37,449
I mean, she's just...

437
00:25:38,107 --> 00:25:40,196
I mean, she just takes
such great care of him.

438
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,889
Look, Kenny, they're gonna be okay...

439
00:25:48,474 --> 00:25:51,747
Boyd, Kristi, all of 'em.

440
00:25:52,108 --> 00:25:53,818
We're just gonna go out there
first thing in the morning.

441
00:25:53,822 --> 00:25:55,650
We're gonna pick 'em
up and bring 'em home.

442
00:25:56,696 --> 00:25:58,489
I'm not going.

443
00:26:00,157 --> 00:26:01,201
Of course you are.

444
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:03,021
I can't.

445
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,247
I...

446
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:09,646
After what happened to Lauren and Megan,

447
00:26:11,318 --> 00:26:13,842
I feel like I'm hanging
on by a thread here.

448
00:26:17,053 --> 00:26:20,442
I can't find any more bodies.

449
00:26:21,972 --> 00:26:23,713
I just can't.

450
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:44,254
Oh, fuck.

451
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:48,602
Hey.

452
00:26:48,614 --> 00:26:49,745
Um...

453
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,186
Hey.

454
00:26:51,255 --> 00:26:54,084
Uh, do, do you know where Fatima is?

455
00:26:54,449 --> 00:26:57,583
Yeah, she's just... Um,
she's in the restroom.

456
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,012
Ah. Um...

457
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,270
You're... you're Julie, right?

458
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:07,190
And you're Ellis.

459
00:27:07,195 --> 00:27:09,747
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

460
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:13,109
Yeah.

461
00:27:14,607 --> 00:27:16,482
Um, hey, look,

462
00:27:16,487 --> 00:27:20,114
I'm sorry about what happened,
uh, downstairs earlier.

463
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:25,275
Um, have... have you had a
chance to see your mom yet?

464
00:27:25,491 --> 00:27:27,205
No.

465
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,083
Uh, she's still talking to...

466
00:27:30,088 --> 00:27:31,814
- To Donna?
- Donna, yeah.

467
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:32,907
Yeah, right.

468
00:27:32,912 --> 00:27:34,294
Right.

469
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:37,006
Right.

470
00:27:39,052 --> 00:27:42,177
I... I like your drawings.

471
00:27:42,614 --> 00:27:43,961
Thank you.

472
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:45,505
Yeah.

473
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,796
You're fucking crazy.

474
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:54,381
You don't know how many nights

475
00:27:54,385 --> 00:27:56,591
I've laid awake wishing that were true.

476
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:01,331
How many times did you
drive down that road today?

477
00:28:01,588 --> 00:28:03,419
How many hours did you spend in the car,

478
00:28:03,424 --> 00:28:06,724
going in a straight line that
somehow ended up being a circle?

479
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:09,153
You saw those things outside.

480
00:28:09,158 --> 00:28:11,297
No, no, no, no, no, no.

481
00:28:11,302 --> 00:28:13,687
I don't know what I saw.

482
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,786
That's what my sister said.

483
00:28:16,688 --> 00:28:18,802
Goddamn it, she was stubborn.

484
00:28:20,435 --> 00:28:22,002
How about a drink?

485
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,310
Yep, I'm gonna pour you a drink.

486
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,486
My sister, she was a real character.

487
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:33,354
Not a woman to be trifled
with, I'll tell you that.

488
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,848
She'd kick the teeth off a bear

489
00:28:36,853 --> 00:28:39,073
if it looked at her sideways.

490
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,457
Me and her, we were on
a little hunting trip

491
00:28:45,462 --> 00:28:47,856
when we saw that
goddamn tree in the road.

492
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:53,287
That's right. Everyone sees the tree.

493
00:28:54,297 --> 00:28:56,681
Those motherfucking crows.

494
00:28:59,692 --> 00:29:01,691
It was right before sunset.

495
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:04,177
We'd already been driving half the day.

496
00:29:04,182 --> 00:29:05,880
There was a motel a few miles back.

497
00:29:05,885 --> 00:29:07,285
I said, "Why don't we grab a room?"

498
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,716
"Start fresh in the morning
when the tree is cleared."

499
00:29:09,896 --> 00:29:12,315
But my sister didn't
want the deer to spoil.

500
00:29:12,572 --> 00:29:14,521
Plus, we'd run outta beer.

501
00:29:15,262 --> 00:29:18,377
It was already dark when we got here.

502
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:21,341
First time through, didn't even stop.

503
00:29:21,716 --> 00:29:23,857
Saw some folks in the
road, drove right by.

504
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:27,717
Second time through, one of
them stood in front of the car.

505
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,588
Wouldn't get out of the way.

506
00:29:29,593 --> 00:29:33,119
Just stood there, smiling.

507
00:29:34,402 --> 00:29:37,536
I thought my sister was gonna
run the son of a bitch over.

508
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:41,431
She never did have much
patience for assholes.

509
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:46,959
Instead, she grabbed her
shotgun and got out of the car

510
00:29:46,964 --> 00:29:50,228
and started screaming at it,
making all sorts of threats.

511
00:29:50,882 --> 00:29:54,190
But it just stood there, smiling.

512
00:29:56,663 --> 00:29:59,091
I'll never forget how it stood there.

513
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:01,630
So still.

514
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,158
And then it ripped her face off,

515
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:09,380
right in front of me,
ripped it clean off.

516
00:30:09,995 --> 00:30:13,172
Started skinning her with
its hands in the street,

517
00:30:13,415 --> 00:30:15,599
just like we used to skin those deer.

518
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:21,114
I couldn't move. I couldn't breathe.

519
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,722
I just froze.

520
00:30:25,098 --> 00:30:27,310
And then I saw another
one coming toward the car,

521
00:30:27,315 --> 00:30:29,143
and that's when I ran.

522
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:32,422
I couldn't even tell you
which direction I ran.

523
00:30:32,427 --> 00:30:34,271
They seemed to be everywhere.

524
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,528
So I found a place to hide,

525
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:42,183
some bushes at the edge of the forest.

526
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:43,929
I crawled into them and hid.

527
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,677
That's what people used
to do to survive here.

528
00:30:50,176 --> 00:30:53,583
They'd crawl into the bushes
or find a place to hide

529
00:30:54,073 --> 00:30:56,989
and pray that they made
it through till morning.

530
00:30:57,995 --> 00:31:02,497
So, there I was,
crouching in those bushes,

531
00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:05,251
and when the blood stopped
pounding in my head,

532
00:31:06,207 --> 00:31:09,357
I realized I could still
hear my sister screaming.

533
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:15,771
They weren't just killing
her; they were torturing her.

534
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:24,075
Those, uh, things out there, they...

535
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:28,867
They like to hunt,

536
00:31:29,448 --> 00:31:31,802
they like to play,

537
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:35,271
so they were making it last.

538
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,677
And I just left her there.

539
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:43,732
See, you were lucky;

540
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:46,403
the sun was still in the
sky when you got here,

541
00:31:46,408 --> 00:31:47,974
people came to help.

542
00:31:47,979 --> 00:31:49,807
Not everybody gets that.

543
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:57,888
It's been, uh, three years,
six months and 17 days,

544
00:31:58,665 --> 00:32:02,190
and I can still hear my
sister screaming in my head.

545
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,352
What is that?

546
00:32:09,357 --> 00:32:12,490
Saline helps clean the wounds.

547
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,398
I thought saline comes in bags.

548
00:32:14,403 --> 00:32:15,543
Well, we don't exactly have much

549
00:32:15,547 --> 00:32:17,333
in the way of supplies around here.

550
00:32:17,338 --> 00:32:20,020
Couple machines we stripped off
an ambulance a few years back,

551
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:23,216
but for the most part we
just improvise where we can.

552
00:32:23,221 --> 00:32:25,093
So, what are... Are you a doctor?

553
00:32:25,547 --> 00:32:27,955
I was a third-year medical student.

554
00:32:28,217 --> 00:32:31,002
Wasn't exactly the
residency I had in mind.

555
00:32:32,907 --> 00:32:34,256
How about you?

556
00:32:34,513 --> 00:32:36,255
Engineer.

557
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,218
I build theme park attractions.

558
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:42,521
Roller coasters, drop
towers, stuff like that.

559
00:32:44,603 --> 00:32:45,784
What?

560
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:49,885
Nothing. It's just you're still
speaking in the present tense.

561
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,109
Hey.

562
00:32:51,114 --> 00:32:52,405
Sorry.

563
00:32:52,964 --> 00:32:54,749
Dad?

564
00:32:55,795 --> 00:32:57,771
Hi, honey.

565
00:32:58,002 --> 00:32:59,692
Hey.

566
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:02,154
How are you?

567
00:33:03,036 --> 00:33:04,803
It hurts.

568
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:07,981
I know. You got a
little banged up, but...

569
00:33:08,795 --> 00:33:10,592
I saw it.

570
00:33:11,146 --> 00:33:12,458
What'd you see?

571
00:33:13,114 --> 00:33:15,841
I saw the Lake of Tears.

572
00:33:17,517 --> 00:33:20,476
It was a drawing on the wall.

573
00:33:24,316 --> 00:33:26,695
There were so many drawings on the wall.

574
00:33:30,713 --> 00:33:34,177
Like when I used to draw with crayons

575
00:33:36,042 --> 00:33:39,107
and you would put it on the fridge?

576
00:33:45,562 --> 00:33:49,432
And we were all there in the drawings,

577
00:33:49,437 --> 00:33:52,310
you and me...

578
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:55,381
and Mom and Julie.

579
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,848
But somebody screamed

580
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:13,922
because the spider came
down from the ceiling.

581
00:34:14,965 --> 00:34:16,773
Hey.

582
00:34:17,568 --> 00:34:21,070
You're gonna be okay.
We're all gonna be okay.

583
00:34:22,582 --> 00:34:24,461
It's okay.

584
00:34:27,871 --> 00:34:30,628
The doctor told us that the dementia

585
00:34:30,633 --> 00:34:33,305
was progressing pretty rapidly, but...

586
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,727
I dunno. He said, you know,

587
00:34:36,732 --> 00:34:39,344
we should make sure to lock
the doors at night and...

588
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:43,359
and put a monitor on him,
maybe even strap him into bed.

589
00:34:43,364 --> 00:34:44,757
Right.

590
00:34:44,762 --> 00:34:48,516
None of which we did,
of course, because...

591
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:50,909
Hey, it's okay.

592
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:52,128
- It's fine.
- Come on.

593
00:34:52,751 --> 00:34:55,618
Oh. I'm good. I'm good.

594
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:56,915
Kenny, maybe we should, uh...

595
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,492
It was just hard,

596
00:34:59,824 --> 00:35:02,813
you know, to believe that he was...

597
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:09,354
So, one night, he
wanders out of the house,

598
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,407
and we didn't even know
he was gone at first.

599
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:17,414
He took the bus all the way to the city.

600
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:21,148
My mom was so angry.

601
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:24,008
We drove out to pick him
up and she kept saying,

602
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:29,844
"Well, how could he do this?"
You know, "He knows better."

603
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:35,039
And I'm just like,
"Mom, he has dementia."

604
00:35:35,862 --> 00:35:37,865
"He's not trying to
fucking piss you off."

605
00:35:39,922 --> 00:35:41,711
Well, you know what?

606
00:35:41,716 --> 00:35:43,992
The important thing is
you found him, right?

607
00:35:47,002 --> 00:35:49,352
On the drive home,

608
00:35:50,116 --> 00:35:52,219
I kept thinking,

609
00:35:53,354 --> 00:35:56,180
we got a second chance now, you know?

610
00:35:57,695 --> 00:35:59,336
To do things right.

611
00:36:02,094 --> 00:36:04,047
And then you saw the tree.

612
00:36:06,514 --> 00:36:08,045
And then we saw the tree.

613
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,096
Yeah.

614
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,730
Can you guys maybe not sit
in the middle of the stairs?

615
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:16,125
Right. Uh, sorry. Sorry about that.

616
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,392
We're just, uh...

617
00:36:19,641 --> 00:36:21,686
Sorry.

618
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:24,486
Yeah, Kenny, you know
what? Maybe we should, uh...

619
00:36:26,428 --> 00:36:28,352
Kenny?

620
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:46,858
Sara?

621
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:49,772
I was taking a nap.
I didn't hear you come in.

622
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:52,384
I'm gonna get some dinner started.

623
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:03,621
I didn't have a choice.

624
00:37:05,418 --> 00:37:07,013
Oh.

625
00:37:07,703 --> 00:37:09,600
Shh.

626
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:14,350
Will you please help me?

627
00:37:21,717 --> 00:37:23,719
Okay. You get some rest.

628
00:37:23,724 --> 00:37:25,760
I'm gonna go check on
the boy from the crash.

629
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:26,896
N-no.

630
00:37:27,152 --> 00:37:29,538
This place, how...

631
00:37:29,543 --> 00:37:32,807
How you say? Scary.

632
00:37:33,072 --> 00:37:34,769
Night scary.

633
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:36,899
Nightmare?

634
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:42,614
When this... When this no work,

635
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:45,693
that's nightmare.

636
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:49,145
Yeah, nightmare.

637
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,543
Okay.

638
00:37:55,534 --> 00:37:57,449
You get some sleep.

639
00:38:51,263 --> 00:38:53,048
So, how does this work?

640
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:55,192
Oh God, Jim, no. No!

641
00:38:55,415 --> 00:38:57,042
No!

642
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:00,223
Hey, hey.

643
00:39:00,228 --> 00:39:02,457
Hey, Kristi! Hey.

644
00:39:02,462 --> 00:39:04,551
Kristi, Kristi, you're okay.

645
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,726
You just dozed off. Okay?

646
00:39:10,255 --> 00:39:11,692
Is he okay?

647
00:39:12,376 --> 00:39:13,879
Hey.

648
00:39:14,874 --> 00:39:16,770
Good. Okay.

649
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,239
The sun's coming up. It's morning.

650
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,770
We're good.

651
00:39:24,444 --> 00:39:25,967
We're okay.

652
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:27,939
All right.

653
00:39:29,062 --> 00:39:30,193
Okay.

654
00:40:23,787 --> 00:40:25,354
Oh, my God.

655
00:40:29,116 --> 00:40:31,064
Oh, my God.

656
00:40:34,689 --> 00:40:37,081
Hey. Is he okay? Is he okay?

657
00:40:37,086 --> 00:40:38,218
He'll be all right.

658
00:40:38,223 --> 00:40:40,520
Hi. Are you okay, baby?

659
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:42,788
Hey, baby, you okay?

660
00:40:43,503 --> 00:40:44,809
I've got you.

661
00:40:44,814 --> 00:40:46,962
Oh, God.

662
00:40:54,103 --> 00:40:55,540
Do you know the story

663
00:40:55,545 --> 00:40:59,760
about the little girl in a room
filled with broken glass?

664
00:41:01,398 --> 00:41:04,836
She knows the broken pieces
used to mean something.

665
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:08,408
She knows there's something
they must have been.

666
00:41:10,727 --> 00:41:12,599
But all she can see are the shards.

667
00:41:15,212 --> 00:41:18,767
And when she tries to
put them back together,

668
00:41:20,298 --> 00:41:21,939
they cut into her skin,

669
00:41:23,306 --> 00:41:26,822
cutting deeper and deeper,

670
00:41:27,392 --> 00:41:30,308
and she bleeds all over the floor.

671
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:35,142
But she keeps on trying.

672
00:41:36,752 --> 00:41:40,802
She keeps trying because
she knows there's an answer.

673
00:41:40,807 --> 00:41:43,392
She knows there's a
shape they used to make.

674
00:41:43,856 --> 00:41:44,856
Sara...

675
00:41:44,861 --> 00:41:46,586
I hear their voices,

676
00:41:48,114 --> 00:41:50,728
and it's just like the broken glass.

677
00:41:52,174 --> 00:41:56,267
They told me it had to look
like it was the monsters.

678
00:41:57,471 --> 00:41:58,955
I didn't want to,

679
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:04,255
but they said it was
the only way to save us,

680
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,001
it was the only way to go home.

681
00:42:06,006 --> 00:42:10,283
Sara... please, just...

682
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:12,403
Just tell me what you did.

683
00:42:19,225 --> 00:42:21,642
I left the door open.

684
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:31,679
Kenny! Kenny, wait!

685
00:42:54,855 --> 00:42:56,379
Hey.

686
00:42:58,383 --> 00:43:00,167
Let me go first.

687
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:02,231
It doesn't have to be you.

688
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:23,249
No!

689
00:44:36,926 --> 00:44:38,145
Kenny.

690
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:41,773
Uh, where's the family?

691
00:44:44,143 --> 00:44:46,536
Father Khatri's bringing
them back up to Colony House.

692
00:44:48,264 --> 00:44:50,310
They shouldn't be up there.

693
00:44:50,534 --> 00:44:55,278
Well, it's what they wanted.
It's only for the night.

694
00:44:57,014 --> 00:44:58,796
What are you doing out here?

695
00:44:59,476 --> 00:45:01,406
I, uh...

696
00:45:02,006 --> 00:45:05,401
I needed some wood for the new set.

697
00:45:05,968 --> 00:45:07,835
We never varnished the pieces.

698
00:45:12,965 --> 00:45:14,706
We made it together.

699
00:45:17,082 --> 00:45:19,429
It's one of the only
things we ever, uh...

700
00:45:24,156 --> 00:45:26,171
It's ruined now.

701
00:45:26,176 --> 00:45:28,202
The blood soaked into the wood.

702
00:45:30,135 --> 00:45:33,051
You know, with my Dad,

703
00:45:33,376 --> 00:45:37,946
every single game would
always end the same way.

704
00:45:38,942 --> 00:45:40,699
I'd be down to my last piece,

705
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,836
and I'd just keep moving
'round the same three spaces,

706
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:44,339
trying to avoid him.

707
00:45:45,206 --> 00:45:46,378
Kenny...

708
00:45:46,383 --> 00:45:48,191
Those things,

709
00:45:50,029 --> 00:45:53,878
they walk; they never run.

710
00:45:55,312 --> 00:45:57,140
You ever notice that?

711
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,494
Yeah.

712
00:46:00,193 --> 00:46:02,706
It's like they're taking
their time, because...

713
00:46:03,978 --> 00:46:07,800
because they know there's
only so many places we can go.

714
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:17,132
I think we're running out of
spaces on the board, Sheriff.

715
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:50,369
_

716
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:39,698
_

717
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:47,723
Norman, they made it back
