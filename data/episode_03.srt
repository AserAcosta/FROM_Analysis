00:00:09,014 --> 00:00:10,585
Previously, on From...

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,945
Is Daddy coming home?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,221
Any second now.

5
00:00:14,226 --> 00:00:15,749
You go start saying your prayers.

6
00:00:15,754 --> 00:00:17,257
I'll be there in a minute.

7
00:00:17,262 --> 00:00:20,375
- Meagan, what are you doing?
- Maybe I can come in.

8
00:00:21,193 --> 00:00:23,953
Meagan, no!

9
00:00:27,544 --> 00:00:29,372
You want a drink, huh?

10
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:30,938
- Get the...
- No.

11
00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:33,129
A man protects his family, Frank.

12
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:34,471
Open your eyes and look!

13
00:00:34,476 --> 00:00:36,335
Look at what you did. Look at them.

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,515
No!

15
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:40,679
Tell my parents I said goodbye.

16
00:00:40,684 --> 00:00:43,122
Mom, Julie killed Norman.

17
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:45,997
- What happened to Norman?
- The monsters killed them.

18
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:47,835
There's no such thing
as monsters, honey.

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,726
Why is there a tree in
the middle of the road?

20
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:51,950
Must've gotten knocked down
in a storm or something.

21
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:54,190
Oh, this can't be the same place.

22
00:00:54,837 --> 00:00:56,460
Excuse me?

23
00:00:56,883 --> 00:00:59,953
We're trying to get back
onto the highway. Could you...

24
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:02,375
We're on the same fucking road.

25
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,601
Dad, I think he's bleeding.
There's something in his leg.

26
00:01:15,606 --> 00:01:16,757
Are you a doctor?

27
00:01:16,762 --> 00:01:18,773
I was a third-year medical student.

28
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:22,375
Please stop. It hurts. Ow!

29
00:01:23,265 --> 00:01:24,860
We can make it to Colony House.

30
00:01:24,864 --> 00:01:26,594
Run as fast as you can,
no matter what you see.

31
00:01:26,598 --> 00:01:28,906
No matter what you
hear, you do not stop.

32
00:01:28,911 --> 00:01:31,000
Hey, I need help here!

33
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:34,289
Hey. Hey! Donna, let us in!

34
00:01:35,517 --> 00:01:36,945
You're from one of those two cars?

35
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,485
That hasn't happened
in a long, long time.

36
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,617
What do you think it means?

37
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:44,148
There are things you need
to know about where you are.

38
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:47,571
This, unfortunately, is gonna
be the worst conversation

39
00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:48,576
of your life.

40
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:49,898
Do you believe in monsters?

41
00:01:49,903 --> 00:01:51,554
Why did you bring me here?

42
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:54,031
'Cause I wanted you to
see that if you climb

43
00:01:54,036 --> 00:01:57,343
high enough, even a nightmare
can look like a dream.

44
00:01:57,348 --> 00:02:00,202
- This isn't your fault.
- What do you mean?

45
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:01,710
I hear their voices.

46
00:02:01,715 --> 00:02:04,179
They said it was the
only way to go home.

47
00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:06,033
Sara, just tell me what you did.

48
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:08,253
I left the door open.

49
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:11,112
Those things. They walk.

50
00:02:11,117 --> 00:02:12,226
They never run.

51
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:15,104
They know there's only
so many places we can go.

52
00:02:15,109 --> 00:02:17,421
I feel like I'm hanging
on by a thread here.

53
00:02:17,426 --> 00:02:21,023
I can't find any more bodies.

54
00:02:21,963 --> 00:02:24,773
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

55
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:57,375
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Come on! Come on!

56
00:02:58,652 --> 00:03:01,023
Open the damn door!

57
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:13,628
You have a bad dream?

58
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:15,200
Yeah.

59
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:19,414
Yeah. Yeah.

60
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:25,609
Tobey!

61
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:28,687
Somebody get me out of
this fucking thing. Hey!

62
00:03:28,692 --> 00:03:30,875
- Tobey, where are you?
- What's going on?

63
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,099
Anybody fucking... Hey.

64
00:03:32,104 --> 00:03:34,334
Shut the fuck up. People
are trying to sleep.

65
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,070
- Who the fuck are you?
- Sorry.

66
00:03:37,075 --> 00:03:39,165
I'm usually more cordial when I do this.

67
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,718
You picked one hell of a
time to finally wake up.

68
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,251
Listen. I don't know
what's going on here,

69
00:03:45,255 --> 00:03:47,554
alright, but you get me
outta these fucking straps

70
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:49,515
right fucking now, or
I swear to God I'm...

71
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,218
What?

72
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:54,451
Do you have any idea who I am?

73
00:03:54,456 --> 00:03:56,346
Oh, shit. You're one of those.

74
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:57,715
One of what?

75
00:03:58,189 --> 00:03:59,233
Okay.

76
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:02,553
Let's start at the beginning.

77
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:32,016
You hungry, Frank?

78
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:34,088
Anything you need?

79
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:39,795
Look.

80
00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:42,304
It's important for
you to understand that

81
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:46,912
what happens tonight...
it's not personal.

82
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:50,121
I know.

83
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:54,967
She liked you.

84
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:57,365
Lauren.

85
00:07:58,721 --> 00:08:00,114
She always liked you.

86
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:04,568
She said you were hard on
people 'cause you had to be.

87
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:09,334
That you made the decisions
other people couldn't.

88
00:08:11,793 --> 00:08:13,888
You're the one who was
gonna get everybody home.

89
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:29,904
I wasn't always like this, you know.

90
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:33,349
None of us were.

91
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:37,697
Look.

92
00:08:37,702 --> 00:08:39,631
If there's anything you need,

93
00:08:40,016 --> 00:08:42,192
anyone you wanna see, maybe,

94
00:08:43,048 --> 00:08:44,834
tie up loose ends...

95
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:48,945
There is one thing I'd like to do.

96
00:08:50,676 --> 00:08:52,982
So, you're telling me that right now

97
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,888
I'm in a town I can't leave,

98
00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:58,365
and that every night
when the sun goes down,

99
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,592
monsters come from
the forest to hunt us?

100
00:09:02,617 --> 00:09:04,575
Monsters who, incidentally,

101
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,474
killed my friend the other night.

102
00:09:06,843 --> 00:09:08,323
Yeah.

103
00:09:12,662 --> 00:09:14,186
Yeah.

104
00:09:18,904 --> 00:09:20,568
Fuck off.

105
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:28,040
This is... this is something.

106
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:30,594
Where did he... where did he find you?

107
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:31,653
Who?

108
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:33,475
Tobey. Are you guys individual hires,

109
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,395
or is this one of those
traveling companies?

110
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,707
'Cause, I mean, you play
the whole thing pretty great.

111
00:09:37,712 --> 00:09:39,271
I buy it.

112
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:41,532
Not him so much. I just...

113
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:43,093
I thought you were trying
a little bit too hard.

114
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:44,840
But otherwise, I...

115
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:49,985
Bravo. Oh. Money well spent.

116
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,324
So, uh, okay.

117
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:53,505
So, what's next? Is there, uh...

118
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,686
Is there, like, some kind
of puzzle I have to solve?

119
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,504
Mmm.

120
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:59,207
Actually, you know what? Never mind.

121
00:09:59,212 --> 00:10:01,779
- Don't spoil it for me.
- Where are you going?

122
00:10:03,681 --> 00:10:05,121
Well, I'm not gonna solve the puzzle

123
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:06,365
sitting here all day.

124
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,298
I'm gonna, you know, check out the town,

125
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:10,294
turn over a few stones.

126
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,085
Fuck. Fuckin' Tobey.

127
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,990
This must have cost a fortune.

128
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:18,743
You want me to keep an eye on him?

129
00:10:18,748 --> 00:10:20,532
No.

130
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,408
Let him wander around town for a while.

131
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,067
We got enough to deal with here.

132
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:29,629
Ha.

133
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:34,803
Okay.

134
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:36,467
It's not quite my Giacometti,

135
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:39,021
but, uh, it'll do.

136
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:40,722
Oh, perfect!

137
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,521
Is that for me?

138
00:10:42,993 --> 00:10:44,516
Excuse me?

139
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:47,763
Hey. Do you, uh... do you
have anything motorized,

140
00:10:47,768 --> 00:10:50,178
- like a scooter or something?
- What? No.

141
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,124
No? Okay. This'll do. Thank you.

142
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:53,951
I... No, that's my... Uh...

143
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:08,803
Hey, buddy.

144
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:11,224
Can I go outside today?

145
00:11:11,229 --> 00:11:12,974
Oh, honey.

146
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:15,365
You need to stay in bed a little longer.

147
00:11:15,626 --> 00:11:18,194
I'm tired of staying in bed.

148
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:20,928
And I don't like these pajamas.

149
00:11:21,457 --> 00:11:23,716
They're itchy and they don't fit right.

150
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:24,940
Oh, come on.

151
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:26,751
Your dad went to
the RV to get our stuff.

152
00:11:26,756 --> 00:11:29,123
So tonight you're gonna
sleep in your own pajamas.

153
00:11:29,128 --> 00:11:30,565
We all should've gone.

154
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:33,009
Well, we thought it was
best if Dad went on his own.

155
00:11:33,014 --> 00:11:34,926
Well, I don't like people
going through my stuff.

156
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,148
Nobody's gonna do that.

157
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,328
Yeah, okay.

158
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,606
How long are we gonna be here?

159
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,941
We are, uh... we're figuring that out.

160
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:46,849
Hey. You hungry?

161
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,196
I saw they're making eggs.
Do you want some eggs?

162
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:50,717
Hobo eggs?

163
00:11:50,722 --> 00:11:52,459
No. No, no, no. No hobo eggs.

164
00:11:52,464 --> 00:11:54,092
But they have oatmeal.

165
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,381
Okay.

166
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,423
What about you? You hungry?

167
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:00,849
Uh, no. I think I'm
just gonna go for a walk.

168
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:03,388
- Okay. Stay close.
- Yeah.

169
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:08,553
I am going to get you your oatmeal.

170
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:10,251
Stay there.

00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:34,995
You okay?

185
00:13:38,513 --> 00:13:40,513
Here. Let me get that.

186
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,492
One...

187
00:14:11,387 --> 00:14:12,780
three...

188
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,904
four, five.

189
00:14:27,262 --> 00:14:28,568
Berries?

190
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,285
I'm okay.

191
00:14:33,255 --> 00:14:35,779
There's an apple tree out
back if you'd prefer that.

192
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:40,183
I see you grow your own food.

193
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,529
Supermarkets around
here are terrible, so...

194
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:48,366
Oh.

195
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:50,131
You're joking.

196
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,665
Ellis and your dad
are gonna be back soon.

197
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,709
You'll feel a lot better

198
00:14:54,714 --> 00:14:56,367
once you have some of your own things.

199
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:58,187
Yeah, I guess.

200
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:01,291
Hey.

201
00:15:03,473 --> 00:15:05,040
You doing okay?

202
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:09,646
No. Not really.

203
00:15:10,861 --> 00:15:12,558
Come here.

204
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:25,658
All right.

205
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:27,310
Let's see what we got here, bud.

206
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:30,881
I heard you were getting
a little itchy, so...

207
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,670
Thank you, Dad.

208
00:15:32,675 --> 00:15:34,155
You're welcome.

209
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:37,959
Um, how did it go?

210
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:42,893
It was, uh... it was good.

211
00:15:42,904 --> 00:15:44,248
Yeah?

212
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,505
Are my books in there?

213
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:48,513
Oh.

214
00:15:48,518 --> 00:15:51,684
Books! How did I forget books?

215
00:15:51,815 --> 00:15:52,903
Dad...

216
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:54,866
Oh, let's see. Maybe there's one.

217
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,481
Maybe I can find something.

218
00:15:56,486 --> 00:16:00,212
Oh, wait a minute. We have books.

219
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,544
What do we want?

220
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:06,474
Do we want Adventures
of the Grand Gooligog?

221
00:16:08,277 --> 00:16:09,871
Flight of the Cromenockle?

222
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:11,791
Ah. The Cromenockle.

223
00:16:11,796 --> 00:16:13,276
That's my favorite.

224
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:15,143
Make the sound.

225
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:18,990
Make the sound? I have no idea
what you're even... doo-ooh!

226
00:16:33,248 --> 00:16:35,021
She doesn't sound like that.

227
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:37,771
No? Does it sound like...

228
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,717
No. Stop. Stop it.

229
00:16:42,722 --> 00:16:44,365
Okay, okay, okay.

230
00:16:44,385 --> 00:16:46,261
There's gonna be two
Cromenockles for you.

231
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:47,615
Two.

232
00:16:53,607 --> 00:16:55,977
Two Cromenockles for the cave.

233
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:58,178
Two Cromenockles for you.

234
00:16:59,607 --> 00:17:00,887
Careful with your leg.

235
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,322
Julie, look. We got our stuff.

236
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:05,845
Yeah. So I see.

237
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:08,334
- Hey, come here.
- Julie!

238
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,589
We're reading the Cromenockle.

239
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:12,752
Julie!

240
00:17:14,464 --> 00:17:16,982
- Yeah. It's really funny.
- Hey.

241
00:17:16,987 --> 00:17:18,552
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

242
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:20,092
Father Khatri is here

243
00:17:20,097 --> 00:17:22,166
to talk to you about
the choosing ceremony.

244
00:17:22,647 --> 00:17:24,386
What's the choosing ceremony?

245
00:17:24,568 --> 00:17:26,326
I'll let him fill you in.

246
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:28,763
All newcomers have to decide
where they're gonna live.

247
00:17:28,768 --> 00:17:31,224
Here in Colony House
or down in the town.

248
00:17:31,229 --> 00:17:33,310
It's just part of how we do things here.

249
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:37,084
I'd like to take the both
of you, show you around.

250
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,772
Maybe take you to the
house you'd be staying in,

251
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:40,146
should you choose the town.

252
00:17:40,151 --> 00:17:41,928
Well, I wanna come.

253
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,803
What? This is about all of us, right?

254
00:17:44,808 --> 00:17:45,810
I wanna see.

255
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,466
We need you to stay
here and be with Ethan.

256
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,777
Donna can watch Ethan.

257
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:54,435
Okay. Fine.

258
00:17:55,112 --> 00:17:56,982
You guys go ahead.

259
00:17:58,206 --> 00:17:59,294
Hey.

260
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:01,858
We won't be gone long.

261
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:03,256
Okay.

262
00:18:04,746 --> 00:18:05,763
You know what?

263
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:07,663
Maybe I should stay.
I shouldn't leave her alone.

264
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:11,036
I think it's very important
that both of you see this.

265
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,396
It's gonna be okay.

266
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:14,088
She's a tough kid.

267
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,741
Takes after her mother.

268
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:18,343
Come.

269
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:37,521
Good morning, everybody.

270
00:18:37,526 --> 00:18:39,717
What's cooking today, huh?

271
00:18:41,973 --> 00:18:43,769
Is this where I find my next clue?

272
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:45,124
Is this where the, uh...

273
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:47,553
Is this where the monsters
jump from the shadows?

274
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:50,909
Uh, "Oh, what wonders
will avail themselves

275
00:18:50,914 --> 00:18:55,254
in the quaint little roadside diner

276
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,326
in which my guard hath fallen?"

277
00:18:58,569 --> 00:18:59,959
Huh?

278
00:19:00,329 --> 00:19:01,929
I did some summer stock back in the day.

279
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:04,654
Not bad, right? Oh,
thank you. I'm starving.

280
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:06,879
- What've we got?
- Hey. There's a line.

281
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:08,436
Look. I'm all for authenticity,

282
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:09,660
but I'm also really hungry,

283
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:11,116
and since y'all basically
work for me anyways,

284
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,498
it's kind of okay.

285
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:14,017
Ow. What the...

286
00:19:19,386 --> 00:19:20,866
All right. Jeez.

287
00:19:21,013 --> 00:19:23,381
People really take all this seriously.

288
00:19:32,228 --> 00:19:34,185
What are you doing here?

289
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,469
You promised you'd stay home.

290
00:19:37,474 --> 00:19:39,526
If I didn't show up, they
would have wondered why.

291
00:19:39,782 --> 00:19:41,871
It'll be okay. I wanna help.

292
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:44,661
- Sara...
- I need to help.

293
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,709
You should get back to the barn.

294
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:51,420
- It'll be okay.
- Sara...

295
00:19:51,785 --> 00:19:53,637
I promise.

296
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:05,818
It's the talismans
that keep them out.

297
00:20:05,823 --> 00:20:08,537
Now, there are a number of
other precautions people take.

298
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,662
Nailing the windows shut, for instance.

299
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,858
With a child in the
house, this is a must.

300
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:14,343
Why?

301
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,498
Well, there'll be nights
where these... these things,

302
00:20:17,888 --> 00:20:20,451
they'll try to convince
you to let them in.

303
00:20:20,456 --> 00:20:22,787
And children tend to
be most susceptible.

304
00:20:23,771 --> 00:20:27,646
How are people walking around
like all this is normal?

305
00:20:28,396 --> 00:20:30,006
Well, the people who survive here

306
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:31,763
are the ones who adapt.

307
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:34,395
How exactly do they do that?

308
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:38,454
The way someone who lives
on a fault line, for example.

309
00:20:38,711 --> 00:20:39,755
They adapt to the notion

310
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,800
that the earth could just open up

311
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:42,980
and swallow them at any given moment.

312
00:20:43,236 --> 00:20:44,513
They go on with their lives

313
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:47,131
because that reality is a part
of the world that they live in.

314
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:51,027
Look. I wish there was an
explanation I could give you

315
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:52,642
that would make any of this easier.

316
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:54,834
But it's gonna be fine.

317
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:57,494
Okay? Just always remember.

318
00:20:57,499 --> 00:21:00,335
Place the talisman by the
door. Cover your windows.

319
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,271
Nail your windows shut.

320
00:21:02,276 --> 00:21:05,535
You do these things, your
family's going to be just fine.

321
00:21:05,817 --> 00:21:08,404
Hey. Um, I'm sorry. What's that?

322
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:15,842
Um, we call that the box.

323
00:21:17,248 --> 00:21:19,998
It's our only form of
punishment we have here.

324
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,701
You see, the rules we live by
are meant to protect each other,

325
00:21:24,706 --> 00:21:26,534
to keep each other safe.

326
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:29,748
And when someone's actions or negligence

327
00:21:29,753 --> 00:21:32,531
leads to the death
of a resident in town,

328
00:21:32,562 --> 00:21:36,967
the only punishment for that
crime is a night in the box.

329
00:21:39,162 --> 00:21:40,642
Jesus.

330
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:43,459
But you keep one of those
talismans in there, right?

331
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:45,265
No.

332
00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:48,943
How many times have you used it?

333
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,553
Tonight will be the first.

334
00:21:54,862 --> 00:21:56,631
Look. Come.

335
00:21:56,636 --> 00:21:58,812
- Your house is just up ahead.
- Yeah.

336
00:22:03,974 --> 00:22:07,016
So, it's not much, but
it'll keep you comfortable

337
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:08,718
if you choose to live in town.

338
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:16,146
Looks like somebody's
already living here.

339
00:22:19,998 --> 00:22:23,393
Um, there was a...

340
00:22:23,515 --> 00:22:27,928
There was an incident the
night before you arrived.

341
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,759
The first we'd had in months.

342
00:22:33,308 --> 00:22:35,179
What kind of incident?

343
00:22:35,717 --> 00:22:37,834
The kind that happens
when people are careless.

344
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,756
It was a child?

345
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:02,988
Holy fuck.

346
00:23:03,338 --> 00:23:06,084
Meagan, and her mother Lauren.

347
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:10,775
The father was passed out drunk

348
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,865
at the other end of
town when it happened.

349
00:23:14,146 --> 00:23:17,560
This is what happens
when you break the rules.

350
00:23:28,972 --> 00:23:30,104
Tabitha, wait.

351
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:31,531
No, Jim, I'm sorry. I can't.

352
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:32,881
I can't do that right now.

353
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:34,799
You make it seem like we have a choice.

354
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:35,920
Jim.

355
00:23:35,925 --> 00:23:38,154
Jim, this is fucking insane!

356
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,944
That woman and her little
girl were ripped apart.

357
00:23:41,048 --> 00:23:43,810
Now they're putting the dad
in some fucking box at sundown

358
00:23:43,815 --> 00:23:44,815
for those things to...

359
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,592
You heard what the priest said.

360
00:23:47,638 --> 00:23:48,918
If he'd have followed the rules,

361
00:23:48,923 --> 00:23:50,521
they'd all still be alive right now.

362
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,771
Jim? Why are you... Why are you so eager

363
00:23:54,776 --> 00:23:57,412
to take any of this at face value, Jim?

364
00:24:00,671 --> 00:24:02,953
Because I can still hear
those things whispering

365
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,220
outside the RV.

366
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:07,037
I can still hear them
tapping on the glass.

367
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:11,185
Tabby, whatever this is,
it's real, and we are stuck.

368
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:14,021
So we better figure out
a way to make the best of it.

369
00:24:15,131 --> 00:24:17,525
'Cause we don't want to end up like...

370
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:22,326
No, no, no. No.

371
00:24:29,782 --> 00:24:31,920
This was Meagan's favorite spot.

372
00:24:38,221 --> 00:24:40,163
Put this swing here for her,

373
00:24:40,168 --> 00:24:43,041
and she was always wanting me

374
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:45,771
to push her higher and higher,

375
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:48,881
but Lauren was afraid it wasn't safe.

376
00:24:55,226 --> 00:24:57,881
You'll bury me next to them, right?

377
00:24:58,994 --> 00:25:00,518
Yeah.

378
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,131
Of course.

379
00:25:05,943 --> 00:25:07,592
Okay.

380
00:25:07,998 --> 00:25:10,021
I'll just be a few minutes here.

381
00:25:10,095 --> 00:25:12,771
Okay. Take whatever time you need.

382
00:25:36,974 --> 00:25:38,357
All right, little guy.

383
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:40,787
Give that a try and let
me know how it feels.

384
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:47,360
Feel good?

385
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,295
It hurts my armpit.

386
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,390
Oh, it hurts your armpit? Okay. Hold on.

387
00:25:51,936 --> 00:25:55,094
Here. I'll add a little
extra padding there for you,

388
00:25:55,592 --> 00:25:58,160
and if this feels good,
I'll tie it on later, okay?

389
00:25:58,165 --> 00:25:59,404
Here. Try that.

390
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:02,430
Ready? Here.

391
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:03,904
Let's go down the stairs, yeah.

392
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:05,907
Take your time. There you go, buddy.

393
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:09,240
Come on. Three, two, one.

394
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:10,959
Boom!

395
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,631
He's adorable.

396
00:26:14,786 --> 00:26:16,526
Why are you doing this?

397
00:26:16,914 --> 00:26:18,307
What do you mean?

398
00:26:18,312 --> 00:26:19,966
You guys barely know us.

399
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:24,342
It's just what we do.

400
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:32,888
It's, like, the ultimate escape room.

401
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:35,413
I mean, seriously, I don't know
how he pulled all this together.

402
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:38,788
So, um, I'm thinking

403
00:26:38,793 --> 00:26:41,717
maybe there's a clue in
each one of the buildings?

404
00:26:41,722 --> 00:26:43,768
Hmm? Am I getting warmer?

405
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,113
'Cause I mean, usually, you know,

406
00:26:46,118 --> 00:26:47,958
you have some type of
prompt that lets you know

407
00:26:47,963 --> 00:26:49,834
which direction to
go. But this is, uh...

408
00:26:49,961 --> 00:26:52,084
This is just some next-level shit.

409
00:26:53,922 --> 00:26:55,837
Has, uh...

410
00:26:55,842 --> 00:27:00,396
Has anyone talked to you yet?

411
00:27:00,401 --> 00:27:04,248
Yeah. The lady up at
the, uh, big house. Donna.

412
00:27:04,935 --> 00:27:06,392
I mean, she gave me the whole intro.

413
00:27:06,397 --> 00:27:07,964
You know, the monsters in the forest.

414
00:27:07,969 --> 00:27:10,171
Tobey's dead. Blah, blah, blah.
But she didn't give me any hints

415
00:27:10,175 --> 00:27:12,225
about where I'm supposed to go
next. Here's the thing, though.

416
00:27:12,229 --> 00:27:14,754
Like, as thorough as all this feels,

417
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,979
there's a couple flaws in the logic.

418
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:19,568
I'm sitting here eating eggs in a diner

419
00:27:19,573 --> 00:27:21,678
in a place that's supposed to be, what,

420
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:24,028
some kind of mystical nightmare?

421
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,202
I mean, I don't know about you,

422
00:27:25,206 --> 00:27:27,209
but my nightmares don't
usually serve breakfast.

423
00:27:28,042 --> 00:27:29,202
I suppose you're gonna
tell me you've got chickens

424
00:27:29,206 --> 00:27:30,729
roaming around in the big bad forest?

425
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:33,006
Yeah, but the chickens, the cows?

426
00:27:33,011 --> 00:27:35,053
We don't really know
where they come from.

427
00:27:35,785 --> 00:27:37,265
Mmm.

428
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:40,810
That's actually not bad
for a nightmare breakfast.

429
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,583
I should probably get going.

430
00:27:49,342 --> 00:27:51,779
Am I supposed to get anything from you?

431
00:27:52,622 --> 00:27:54,363
What?

432
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:56,707
I don't know. Like a clue

433
00:27:56,712 --> 00:28:01,287
or some kind of cryptic direction?

434
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:04,912
You know what?
Never mind. I'll figure it out.

435
00:28:07,374 --> 00:28:09,037
Thanks.

436
00:28:17,258 --> 00:28:20,174
- Was that...
- The guy from the other car.

437
00:28:20,234 --> 00:28:22,224
He's gonna get himself killed.

438
00:28:23,098 --> 00:28:26,162
Um, are you hungry? Have
you eaten anything yet?

439
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:28,666
No, I'm fine. I just came
to check on you guys.

440
00:28:28,671 --> 00:28:30,092
Right.

441
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:36,187
Okay.

442
00:28:36,317 --> 00:28:38,131
How's she doing?

443
00:28:38,136 --> 00:28:39,912
Well, she's...

444
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:43,545
Uh, like I said, denial is a
major part of our family tree.

445
00:28:53,305 --> 00:28:55,177
Let's see, now.

446
00:28:55,386 --> 00:28:56,431
Twelve.

447
00:28:57,061 --> 00:29:00,045
Ten, 12.

448
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,748
Okay.

449
00:29:15,902 --> 00:29:17,818
What are you doing?

450
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:20,537
I don't think you're
supposed to be out here.

451
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:23,132
Are you looking for something?

452
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:24,516
Go away.

453
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:27,940
I can help you look. I'm
good at finding stuff.

454
00:29:28,195 --> 00:29:29,795
I'm not looking.

455
00:29:30,507 --> 00:29:31,920
I'm checking.

456
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:35,062
What are you checking?

457
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,874
You ask a lot of questions.

458
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:43,641
That was only three.

459
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,265
- I can help you check.
- No.

460
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,784
No, you're trouble.

461
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,920
Your mom or pop comes back

462
00:29:51,925 --> 00:29:54,037
and they see you out
here, who gets blamed?

463
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,420
And Donna cuts me off.
Then no more peaches.

464
00:29:58,186 --> 00:30:02,412
- What are you talking about?
- Just go away.

465
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:07,599
Have you seen the boy
who lives out here?

466
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:13,279
- What?
- Forget it.

467
00:30:13,284 --> 00:30:15,232
No, no. Hold on.

468
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:18,536
What do you mean "lives out here"?

469
00:30:19,073 --> 00:30:21,597
He's always walking around out here,

470
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:23,763
and I never see him inside.

471
00:30:23,768 --> 00:30:26,099
So I figured he lived
out here somewhere.

472
00:30:26,802 --> 00:30:28,224
Is that right?

473
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:29,958
We're friends.

474
00:30:33,185 --> 00:30:35,013
Are you, now?

475
00:30:35,312 --> 00:30:39,185
Well, it's good to have friends.

476
00:30:39,874 --> 00:30:41,377
Okay.

477
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:44,124
Wait. Hey, come here.

478
00:30:50,627 --> 00:30:52,891
I'm checking to see if they've moved.

479
00:30:53,155 --> 00:30:54,983
If what moved?

480
00:30:55,114 --> 00:30:56,332
The trees.

481
00:30:56,854 --> 00:30:58,503
- Really?
- Yeah.

482
00:30:58,508 --> 00:31:00,284
Did they?

483
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:03,432
Don't know yet. I'm not done checking.

484
00:31:04,187 --> 00:31:05,405
Ethan?

485
00:31:06,502 --> 00:31:08,401
Ethan, what the fuck?

486
00:31:08,406 --> 00:31:10,581
Get back inside. Mom
told me to watch you.

487
00:31:12,182 --> 00:31:13,567
Guess I gotta go.

488
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,135
Yeah. I guess you'd better, then.

489
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,968
Will you let me know about the trees?

490
00:31:16,973 --> 00:31:18,315
I'll keep you looped.

491
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,303
Ethan, now.

492
00:31:20,308 --> 00:31:21,479
Hey.

493
00:31:21,484 --> 00:31:23,323
If you see that friend of yours,

494
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:27,229
tell him Victor says hello.

495
00:31:34,622 --> 00:31:36,363
Don't talk to him.

496
00:31:36,368 --> 00:31:37,499
Why?

497
00:31:37,504 --> 00:31:38,809
Because he's creepy.

498
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:39,989
- No, he's not.
- Come on.

499
00:31:39,994 --> 00:31:42,081
He's checking to see if the trees moved.

500
00:31:42,086 --> 00:31:44,034
Yeah, and that's totally normal.

501
00:31:50,136 --> 00:31:52,901
One, two.

502
00:32:06,203 --> 00:32:09,728
Yahtzee. All right, Tobey.

503
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:11,809
Let's see what you got.

504
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,728
Holy shit.

505
00:32:56,678 --> 00:32:58,375
What the fuck?

506
00:33:15,477 --> 00:33:18,510
Tobey, you're a fucking genius!

507
00:33:31,095 --> 00:33:34,924
Ah. Woo!

508
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:55,479
That's a sight I don't see very often.

509
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:57,792
Yeah, well...

510
00:33:58,553 --> 00:34:00,674
Don't get used to it.

511
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,331
He's not answering.

512
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:08,373
Well, perhaps you're not
listening closely enough.

513
00:34:14,154 --> 00:34:16,112
I can't do it.

514
00:34:19,709 --> 00:34:21,409
Frank. The box.

515
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,193
Can't do it.

516
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:28,706
It was never supposed...

517
00:34:29,591 --> 00:34:32,502
I built the goddamn box as a deterrent.

518
00:34:32,507 --> 00:34:34,291
It's supposed to scare people.

519
00:34:34,296 --> 00:34:38,877
I... can't.

520
00:34:40,976 --> 00:34:42,499
All right.

521
00:34:44,534 --> 00:34:46,307
Let's say you don't.

522
00:34:46,956 --> 00:34:50,264
Let's say you absolve
Frank of all his crimes.

523
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:52,438
Then what?

524
00:34:53,705 --> 00:34:55,924
What happens next time?

525
00:34:56,915 --> 00:35:00,658
I mean, you warned him
on several occasions.

526
00:35:00,663 --> 00:35:02,870
Very publicly, I might add.

527
00:35:03,775 --> 00:35:05,750
How do you think people are gonna react

528
00:35:06,643 --> 00:35:08,723
when you let Frank go?

529
00:35:08,728 --> 00:35:10,712
How much weight do you think the rules

530
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:13,557
that hold this town together will carry?

531
00:35:14,976 --> 00:35:17,022
Aren't you supposed to be talking to me

532
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:19,354
about the virtues of mercy?

533
00:35:21,637 --> 00:35:23,581
I see.

534
00:35:24,157 --> 00:35:25,985
Is that what you'd prefer?

535
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:30,229
Hey. I'd prefer not to put
a broken man in a fucking box

536
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:33,038
to be torn apart when the sun goes down!

537
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,502
That's what I'd prefer.

538
00:35:36,831 --> 00:35:38,653
I'm not gonna stand
here and pretend like

539
00:35:38,658 --> 00:35:40,390
this is an easy decision.

540
00:35:40,395 --> 00:35:42,049
Great.

541
00:35:42,054 --> 00:35:44,901
But you built a guillotine
in the town square.

542
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:48,260
What do you think happens
when people realize

543
00:35:48,265 --> 00:35:50,175
you lack the conviction to use it?

544
00:35:53,053 --> 00:35:55,316
You're a terrible fucking priest.

545
00:35:55,837 --> 00:35:57,034
You know that?

546
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:02,837
Fucking worst.

547
00:36:03,581 --> 00:36:05,116
Now I'm cursing in
the house of the Lord.

548
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,861
What the fuck is this?

549
00:37:01,597 --> 00:37:03,790
Goddamn it!

550
00:37:12,665 --> 00:37:14,227
There's a little shack

551
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,800
about a hundred yards
beyond the tree line.

552
00:37:16,805 --> 00:37:20,314
You take that, you put
it next to the door,

553
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:23,048
and you make whatever
life you can out there.

554
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:38,821
What are you gonna tell everybody?

555
00:37:48,129 --> 00:37:50,173
Thank you all for coming.

556
00:37:51,031 --> 00:37:54,223
Today, our newcomers will
choose where they would like

557
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:55,882
to spend their days here with us.

558
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:57,879
Should you choose to spend your time

559
00:37:57,884 --> 00:37:59,929
with the people of the town

560
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:03,493
to live by our rules for
the good of the community

561
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,366
until we find our way back home,

562
00:38:06,371 --> 00:38:08,392
you will select the rock.

563
00:38:08,696 --> 00:38:12,058
Should you choose to join
with the people of Colony House

564
00:38:12,063 --> 00:38:15,984
to live for today because
tomorrow is not guaranteed,

565
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:17,852
you will select the flower.

566
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:21,748
Now, once you have chosen,
this choice will be final.

567
00:38:22,646 --> 00:38:24,759
- Like many of us here...
- Father Khatri?

568
00:38:24,764 --> 00:38:27,587
Uh, sorry. Do you mind if I, uh...

569
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:30,574
Uh, yeah. Sure.

570
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:35,578
Since we're all gathered here,

571
00:38:35,631 --> 00:38:38,634
figure I might as well address
the elephant in the room.

572
00:38:39,093 --> 00:38:44,540
Been a lot of questions
today about Frank, the box,

573
00:38:45,009 --> 00:38:46,540
the rules.

574
00:38:46,968 --> 00:38:50,595
There is a fine line

575
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,604
between savagery and consequence.

576
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:57,030
And if we're not willing...

577
00:39:01,905 --> 00:39:03,368
Frank?

578
00:39:05,749 --> 00:39:08,273
I'd like to say a few
things, if that's all right.

579
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,759
You know what I've been thinking
about these last couple of days,

580
00:39:22,764 --> 00:39:24,126
sitting in my cell?

581
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:27,495
Christmas.

582
00:39:29,584 --> 00:39:33,407
The last one me and Lauren
and Meagan had before we...

583
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:40,938
I was a good dad, you know?

584
00:39:41,736 --> 00:39:43,384
I mean, I wasn't perfect,

585
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:47,045
but I wasn't like this.

586
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,532
That last Christmas, we got
Meagan her first dollhouse.

587
00:39:54,994 --> 00:39:56,996
And when she saw it,
the look on her face...

588
00:40:02,948 --> 00:40:05,049
I let this town,

589
00:40:05,547 --> 00:40:07,977
those things in the woods,

590
00:40:07,982 --> 00:40:11,551
I let them get to my head, and...

591
00:40:13,424 --> 00:40:14,657
I forgot what really mattered.

592
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,665
I... forgot that if I'd just been

593
00:40:20,062 --> 00:40:21,803
a little stronger...

594
00:40:24,278 --> 00:40:26,810
there might have still
been a Christmas morning

595
00:40:26,815 --> 00:40:28,774
waiting for us all when we got home.

596
00:40:32,908 --> 00:40:35,041
Don't let this place
take that away from you.

597
00:40:36,753 --> 00:40:38,501
Okay?

598
00:40:38,506 --> 00:40:42,119
You look after each other.
You take care of each other.

599
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,718
Remember what you're living for.

600
00:40:50,438 --> 00:40:52,707
I appreciate everything you're
trying to do for me, Sheriff.

601
00:40:52,711 --> 00:40:55,087
No, I do. I really do.

602
00:40:56,786 --> 00:41:01,212
But the only two things that
I love in this world are gone.

603
00:41:03,016 --> 00:41:05,798
And I just wanna see my girls again.

604
00:41:08,106 --> 00:41:12,334
Wait! No! Don't go, Frank.

605
00:41:15,669 --> 00:41:18,640
Goddamn, I love this! It's scary.

606
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:21,368
It's, uh, dramatic. It's...

607
00:41:21,373 --> 00:41:24,123
Okay. Whoa, big fella. Okay.

608
00:41:24,128 --> 00:41:26,704
All right, okay. Easy, easy.

609
00:41:26,709 --> 00:41:28,407
- Easy.
- Pick one.

610
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:31,662
You need to fucking let
me go. Ow! What the fuck?

611
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:33,192
- Pick one!
- I'm gonna fucking sue you.

612
00:41:33,196 --> 00:41:35,405
Ow! Okay. All right. Okay.

613
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,813
- All right. All right?
- Got it.

614
00:41:38,003 --> 00:41:39,003
Let's go.

615
00:41:39,008 --> 00:41:42,040
Damn it! Ow! Damn! Ah!

616
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,852
Oh, you have no idea how
badly you just fucked up, okay?

617
00:41:45,857 --> 00:41:47,120
All right? No idea.

618
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:50,579
I am gonna... I'm gonna
fucking ruin you.

619
00:41:50,584 --> 00:41:52,368
All right, I'm gonna
fucking ruin all of you!

620
00:41:52,373 --> 00:41:55,696
Jade, let me show you something.

621
00:41:57,428 --> 00:41:59,082
Come on.

622
00:42:02,802 --> 00:42:04,946
Frank, you don't have to do this.

623
00:42:04,951 --> 00:42:06,845
You shouldn't be making decisions
like this when you're hurting.

624
00:42:06,849 --> 00:42:08,829
No. Look. I'm the most clear-minded

625
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:10,954
I've been in a long time. Trust me.

626
00:42:12,331 --> 00:42:13,743
All right.

627
00:42:13,748 --> 00:42:15,532
Let's get this done.

628
00:42:17,691 --> 00:42:19,988
Are you living in town or Colony House?

629
00:42:19,993 --> 00:42:21,336
Town.

630
00:42:21,907 --> 00:42:23,083
Sorry.

631
00:42:23,323 --> 00:42:25,064
You each have to say it.

632
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:26,687
Oh, yeah. Town.

633
00:42:28,415 --> 00:42:29,581
Ethan.

634
00:42:29,586 --> 00:42:30,701
Town.

635
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,854
Okay.

636
00:42:32,859 --> 00:42:33,990
Julie.

637
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,531
Colony House.

638
00:42:36,852 --> 00:42:39,954
- What? No, no.
- No. She doesn't mean that.

639
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:41,292
Girl made her choice.

640
00:42:41,297 --> 00:42:42,969
- Hold on a second.
- It's done.

641
00:42:42,974 --> 00:42:44,992
- Ceremony is over.
- No, no, I'm sorry.

642
00:42:44,997 --> 00:42:46,989
She can't make that
decision. She's underage.

643
00:42:46,994 --> 00:42:48,016
- No.
- Mom, it's fine.

644
00:42:48,021 --> 00:42:50,829
No, it's not fine. Come
and stay with your family.

645
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,352
You don't have to do that, Julie.

646
00:42:52,357 --> 00:42:54,579
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to my daughter.

647
00:42:54,584 --> 00:42:56,774
Now, there's no way anyone's
gonna expect us to...

648
00:42:56,779 --> 00:42:58,171
Are you gonna say something?

649
00:42:58,176 --> 00:43:00,393
Okay. Everybody just hold on, okay?

650
00:43:00,398 --> 00:43:01,899
Take a breath.

651
00:43:01,904 --> 00:43:03,977
Ju... Julie, Julie.

652
00:43:04,901 --> 00:43:07,375
Do you want to live in Colony House?

653
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:12,306
Yeah.

654
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:15,206
Why are you doing this?

655
00:43:15,211 --> 00:43:17,595
She chose. Your rules, Boyd, not mine.

656
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,985
No, you know what? It's okay.

657
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:21,125
I change my mind. I go.
I choose Colony House.

658
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:22,899
- Tabitha, just...
- What?

659
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:25,011
I'm not standing here,
knowing that my daughter

660
00:43:25,016 --> 00:43:26,369
- is in that fucking house.
- Everything is gonna be okay.

661
00:43:26,373 --> 00:43:28,188
- No, it's not! Fucking no.
- Okay, look.

662
00:43:28,193 --> 00:43:30,192
- We're gonna fix this.
- There is nothing to fix.

663
00:43:30,197 --> 00:43:31,844
Will you shut the fuck up?

664
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:40,082
Please, please, don't
do this now, right here.

665
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,110
My son will be up there.

666
00:43:43,115 --> 00:43:46,196
I promise you she will be looked after.

667
00:43:49,235 --> 00:43:50,453
All right.

668
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:54,305
Uh, everybody, the sun
will be going down soon.

669
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,915
So, uh, thank you for coming.

670
00:43:57,243 --> 00:43:59,329
It's okay. I'll take care of him.

671
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,360
I'm done.

672
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,157
All right. Your boy, the sheriff,
crossed the line,

673
00:44:14,162 --> 00:44:16,727
so just call me a car or whatever,

674
00:44:16,732 --> 00:44:19,952
'cause I'm fucking done. Fuck.

675
00:44:20,141 --> 00:44:22,485
I need you to understand something.

676
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:26,601
No one is trying to be cruel to you.

677
00:44:26,606 --> 00:44:28,608
But you need to
understand what's going on.

678
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:30,680
Are you listening? Did
you hear what I just said?

679
00:44:30,684 --> 00:44:33,791
I'm not interested.
Okay? This whole thing

680
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,265
lost its interest for me

681
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:37,609
the second that asshole
put his hands on me, and...

682
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:53,160
Okay, you know what?
This isn't funny anymore.

683
00:44:53,438 --> 00:44:55,005
This, uh...

684
00:44:58,386 --> 00:44:59,779
You hear me, guys?

685
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,786
It's not funny anymore!

686
00:45:04,299 --> 00:45:05,604
This, uh...

687
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:17,770
Oh, God.

688
00:45:20,071 --> 00:45:21,835
I... Oh, God.

689
00:45:23,492 --> 00:45:25,277
Oh, God, Jesus.

690
00:45:28,147 --> 00:45:29,616
Tobey?

691
00:45:40,146 --> 00:45:41,718
All right, come on.

692
00:45:42,933 --> 00:45:44,702
There he is.

693
00:46:38,665 --> 00:46:40,679
You get these people home, Sheriff.

694
00:46:41,446 --> 00:46:43,304
I'll do everything I can.

695
00:46:43,387 --> 00:46:45,046
Promise me?

696
00:46:46,238 --> 00:46:48,066
Yeah, Frank.

697
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:49,377
I promise.

698
00:47:05,735 --> 00:47:07,302
I'm ready.

699
00:47:27,757 --> 00:47:29,150
Okay.

700
00:48:34,901 --> 00:48:36,033
Careful. In you go.

701
00:48:41,615 --> 00:48:42,795
There's one outside.

702
00:48:47,765 --> 00:48:49,765
Let's get you settled in.

703
00:49:45,354 --> 00:49:49,140
This is, uh... this is Jade.

704
00:49:51,998 --> 00:49:54,771
_

705
00:49:56,121 --> 00:49:57,271
_

706
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,117
Uh, let's get you set up.

707
00:50:10,618 --> 00:50:13,665
Are you and Daddy gonna sleep in here?

708
00:50:14,476 --> 00:50:16,966
Yeah, yeah.

709
00:50:17,263 --> 00:50:19,568
We're all going to be together.

710
00:50:20,858 --> 00:50:22,951
Is Julie ever coming back?

711
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,271
Honey, she's right up the hill.

712
00:50:25,276 --> 00:50:27,278
You can see her anytime you want.

713
00:50:27,807 --> 00:50:29,548
- Okay.
- Okay?

714
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:33,982
Shall we have a read?

715
00:50:33,987 --> 00:50:35,684
Yeah!

716
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:44,646
All right.

717
00:50:44,651 --> 00:50:46,957
Last I remember, it was chapter three.

718
00:50:47,417 --> 00:50:49,263
Start from the beginning.

719
00:50:51,232 --> 00:50:53,013
Yeah. It has been a while.

720
00:50:55,245 --> 00:50:59,075
Well, it all began one sunny morning,

721
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:02,837
as a cat lay comfortably
basking in the sun,

722
00:51:02,842 --> 00:51:04,409
in a beautiful green shire.

723
00:51:04,414 --> 00:51:06,599
As we always do,

724
00:51:06,604 --> 00:51:09,626
let's welcome our newest family member.

725
00:51:09,631 --> 00:51:10,937
Here's to Julie.

726
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:12,435
To Julie!

727
00:51:15,789 --> 00:51:17,460
Thank you.

728
00:51:17,465 --> 00:51:18,873
Welcome, kiddo.

729
00:51:18,878 --> 00:51:20,923
Oh, we're glad to have you.
