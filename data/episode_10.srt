1
00:00:00,763 --> 00:00:02,518
All I got was some static.

2
00:00:02,778 --> 00:00:03,982
But it worked.

3
00:00:04,006 --> 00:00:05,962
I think if we get it
up over the tree line

4
00:00:05,984 --> 00:00:08,581
and we get it enough power, I
think we could get a signal out.

5
00:00:08,813 --> 00:00:11,002
You went through a farway tree!

6
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:14,792
- Huh?
- Victor said you can go all sorts of places,

7
00:00:14,843 --> 00:00:16,940
so maybe he went somewhere else.

8
00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:19,658
- We have to find him!
- One step at a time.

9
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:20,835
- Hey, Julie.
- What's happening?

10
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:23,176
We're digging a big
hole in the basement.

11
00:00:23,277 --> 00:00:26,127
We're gonna find out where
the electricity comes from.

12
00:00:26,185 --> 00:00:27,563
Has anyone seen Victor?

13
00:00:27,593 --> 00:00:29,844
We have a legitimate
chance here to go home.

14
00:00:29,957 --> 00:00:31,314
You know what? Just go.

15
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,368
I'll stay here, and I'll
figure this out myself.

16
00:00:34,725 --> 00:00:36,572
I know you've had a hard time lately

17
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:39,804
and that this tower
means a lot to everybody,

18
00:00:39,837 --> 00:00:41,682
but I just need you to promise me, okay?

19
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,134
If it falls apart,

20
00:00:43,706 --> 00:00:45,159
if you fall apart,

21
00:00:46,217 --> 00:00:49,000
you'll talk to me, you'll let me help.

22
00:00:51,002 --> 00:00:53,428
- It's okay.
- This radio might actually work.

23
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:56,261
What's it gonna be like for us?

24
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:01,772
This is the only place
we've ever known together.

25
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,375
There's no power source.

26
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:09,257
You need electric?

27
00:01:10,694 --> 00:01:11,694
Yeah.

28
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,967
The problem is you
can't plug anything in.

29
00:01:18,255 --> 00:01:21,134
God knows, whatever's coming up
through those wires is still...

30
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:24,114
Holy shit. I know how to do it.

31
00:01:27,648 --> 00:01:28,825
What is it?

32
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,354
I think I hit the bottom.

33
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:34,062
I can hear them! I can...

34
00:01:34,096 --> 00:01:37,500
No, no. Talk to me. Talk... talk to me.

35
00:01:37,641 --> 00:01:39,490
It was different this time.

36
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:42,464
It was a woman. She said...

37
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:44,558
"Tell Mr. Fish and Loaves

38
00:01:44,874 --> 00:01:46,265
that I was wrong.

39
00:01:46,345 --> 00:01:50,835
There are things out here that
are worse than the monsters."

40
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:54,086
- We shouldn't have come here.
- Shh!

41
00:01:54,476 --> 00:01:57,215
We're okay. We're okay.

42
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,217
I don't think we are.

43
00:02:17,057 --> 00:02:19,298
"Let's go to the tower."

44
00:02:19,498 --> 00:02:22,153
"Behold, the tower."

45
00:02:26,524 --> 00:02:29,719
Hey, I know those guys.

46
00:02:31,232 --> 00:02:32,685
You want me to tell you a story?

47
00:02:32,957 --> 00:02:36,103
It's okay. I can tell
my own stories now.

48
00:02:38,111 --> 00:02:40,432
Well, look at you. You're
all grown up now, huh?

49
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:43,609
What's your story about?

50
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,064
They're trying to find
their way back home.

51
00:02:47,654 --> 00:02:49,295
Hello?

52
00:02:49,354 --> 00:02:51,260
I'm coming! Calm down!

53
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:53,010
Hello?

54
00:02:53,063 --> 00:02:55,085
- What the hell?!
- Ha! I got it!

55
00:02:55,212 --> 00:02:57,397
- You got what?
- Power problem.

56
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,263
- I figured it out.
- What?

57
00:02:59,278 --> 00:03:00,593
- Where is...
- It's okay.

58
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:02,692
... your least favorite
lamp? This one. This is ugly.

59
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,473
- My what?
- Let's use this. Good morning!

60
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,094
- I didn't wake you, did I?
- What's going on?

61
00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:08,875
No, no, no. Wait.

62
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:10,494
What are... what are
you doing? This is not...

63
00:03:10,508 --> 00:03:13,485
What is the biggest problem we
have with powering the signal?

64
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:16,284
Huh? Can't plug anything in, right?

65
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:18,150
The outlets are fucked! The... Sorry.

66
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:20,384
These wires aren't even wires,

67
00:03:20,547 --> 00:03:22,964
so by all rights, this
lamp shouldn't even turn on.

68
00:03:25,015 --> 00:03:27,404
But it does, right?

69
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:29,270
Which means that, no
matter what's going on

70
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,754
with the outlets or the wires,

71
00:03:30,896 --> 00:03:32,441
what comes out here

72
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,363
is the electricity that lights the bulb.

73
00:03:35,484 --> 00:03:36,582
You follow me so far?

74
00:03:36,604 --> 00:03:38,459
- Yes.
- Okay. All right.

75
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,044
Now, this,

76
00:03:42,774 --> 00:03:44,668
this came here in the
back of someone's car,

77
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:46,609
which means that, by all accounts,

78
00:03:46,671 --> 00:03:49,063
this item is completely useless

79
00:03:49,074 --> 00:03:50,505
here in our lovely little hamlet.

80
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,808
Go ahead.

81
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:54,288
But if we take the ends of the wire,

82
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:56,970
all right, and affix it to the socket,

83
00:03:57,535 --> 00:04:00,810
the very place to which actual,

84
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:04,498
bona fide electricity is
somehow being delivered,

85
00:04:04,968 --> 00:04:07,307
and we screw our little
light bulb here back in,

86
00:04:08,918 --> 00:04:10,085
and then...

87
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:16,872
Madam.

88
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,080
- Whoa!
- Huh? You see?

89
00:04:24,143 --> 00:04:26,441
With enough lamps and enough wire...

90
00:04:26,497 --> 00:04:29,014
We could turn Colony
House into a giant battery.

91
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:33,340
Yes! Gold star for Tea Cup!

92
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:36,380
I'm sure you would have
figured it out eventually.

93
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:38,649
Hoo!

94
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:40,409
Do you guys have any snacks?

95
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:42,219
I'm feeling peckish.

96
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:54,519
Do you think they know where they are?

97
00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:57,569
- What?
- The bugs,

98
00:04:57,832 --> 00:05:01,246
the cows, birds.

99
00:05:03,706 --> 00:05:05,304
Do you think they know

100
00:05:06,258 --> 00:05:08,047
the horrible things
they're surrounded by?

101
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:10,060
That they aren't where
they should be or...

102
00:05:12,154 --> 00:05:14,572
Does Mr. Worm just think...

103
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:18,757
... "Here's some dirt,"
just like any other dirt?

104
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:21,938
You know, if you cut a worm in half,

105
00:05:23,196 --> 00:05:25,459
it grows back into two worms?

106
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:28,675
What's your point?

107
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,189
My point is worms are fucking creepy.

108
00:05:32,474 --> 00:05:34,585
I'm sure it feels right at home here.

109
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:38,306
What do you think dragged the tent?

110
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:40,961
I don't know.

111
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,840
Where do you think we are?

112
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,273
I think it's time we find out.

113
00:06:08,878 --> 00:06:10,695
What the fuck?

114
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:14,610
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

115
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:26,453
Now, listen. The trick
to making this all work

116
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,332
is conducting wire.

117
00:08:28,351 --> 00:08:30,389
Right? Just like the
wire we're gonna run

118
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:32,321
from the radio up to
the roof of Colony House,

119
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:34,643
we need enough wire
to run from the lamps

120
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:37,472
inside Colony House
out to the radio itself.

121
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:39,612
Tea Cup, tell them where we get it.

122
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:43,774
Well, basically anything with a cord

123
00:08:43,782 --> 00:08:45,991
that came into town in
the back of someone's car:

124
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,266
appliances, electronics,

125
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:52,633
even the wiring harnesses
in the cars themselves.

126
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,095
Um, you know, that
ambulance outside the clinic?

127
00:08:55,353 --> 00:08:56,941
Probably a gold mine.

128
00:08:56,993 --> 00:08:58,787
Well, there's plenty of
stuff in storage here,

129
00:08:58,813 --> 00:09:00,699
so my kids and I, we're
gonna start in there,

130
00:09:00,745 --> 00:09:03,454
and anyone who wants to
join us is welcome to.

131
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,768
And the rest of you,
scour whatever you can.

132
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:08,170
If we can get enough
wire stripped and spliced,

133
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:10,585
we can be sending out a
transmission before nightfall.

134
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:13,873
All right, you heard
the man. Spread the word

135
00:09:13,913 --> 00:09:15,256
and let's get to work.

136
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:17,704
Let's go, people. Chop, chop.

137
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:19,887
Yep.

138
00:09:21,085 --> 00:09:22,958
All right, nice job, man.

139
00:09:23,143 --> 00:09:25,591
Sorry. Gotta go.

140
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:31,016
Hey! Hey!

141
00:09:31,082 --> 00:09:32,561
His name is Jim!

142
00:09:33,127 --> 00:09:35,588
- What?
- My father's name is Jim.

143
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,718
Uh, yeah. No, I actually,
uh... I knew that.

144
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:41,324
You're such an asshole.

145
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:42,952
I'm sorry. Am I... ?

146
00:09:42,985 --> 00:09:44,778
What am I supposed to do here?

147
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,253
Julie?

148
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:48,701
It's fine. I'll be right there.

149
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,335
Oh, okay, all right.

150
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:51,996
This is like a...

151
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:55,404
It's like a father-daughter thing.

152
00:09:57,455 --> 00:09:59,641
This is, uh... this is
a really nice moment.

153
00:10:00,307 --> 00:10:01,875
You're standing up for your dad.

154
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:04,600
- Good for you.
- Just cut out the 'Tea Cup' shit.

155
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:05,821
Fine.

156
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,949
But I'm calling you
'Spark Plug' from now on.

157
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,384
I like you. Good talk.

158
00:10:10,404 --> 00:10:13,222
I'll see you up there.

159
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:30,954
You missed Jade's big speech.

160
00:10:31,085 --> 00:10:33,387
Yeah, probably for the best.

161
00:10:34,219 --> 00:10:36,550
I thought you'd be up
at the house by now.

162
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:38,588
No, I'm gonna help Kristi gather

163
00:10:38,614 --> 00:10:41,030
whatever wire she can
from the ambulance.

164
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,840
All those different places,

165
00:10:45,985 --> 00:10:47,539
different roads,

166
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:50,285
yet everybody ended up here.

167
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,348
You really think sending out

168
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:56,657
some radio signal's
gonna make a difference?

169
00:10:57,563 --> 00:10:58,895
I hope so.

170
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,606
Radio waves travel
in ways that we can't,

171
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:03,908
so who knows, right?

172
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:06,250
Yeah.

173
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,995
Well, best get at it, I guess.

174
00:11:12,126 --> 00:11:13,519
Thank you.

175
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:45,040
So, how does Troy feel
about giving up the goods?

176
00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:48,037
Well, I mean, he wasn't
thrilled about it,

177
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:49,896
but we had a little chat.

178
00:11:53,072 --> 00:11:54,409
What's with the lamp?

179
00:11:54,468 --> 00:11:57,915
Uh, I had this in the trunk of my car

180
00:11:57,942 --> 00:11:59,434
when we drove in.

181
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:02,772
It, uh... it was my desk
lamp back in college.

182
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,406
Cute.

183
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:08,396
It, uh, doesn't work here, and
I can't even plug it in, but, uh,

184
00:12:08,515 --> 00:12:10,977
it was nice to have something from home

185
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:12,645
that was close by, you know?

186
00:12:13,306 --> 00:12:14,788
The globe actually opens up.

187
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:17,315
My roommate in college
was a bit of a klepto,

188
00:12:17,365 --> 00:12:20,008
so it was kinda like
my secret hiding spot.

189
00:12:20,063 --> 00:12:22,109
- Really?
- Yeah.

190
00:12:22,317 --> 00:12:23,980
What do you keep in there now?

191
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:25,852
Funny you should ask.

192
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,277
Back, uh...

193
00:12:30,402 --> 00:12:32,182
back in school, I used to

194
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:34,293
sit at my desk sometimes,

195
00:12:34,478 --> 00:12:36,622
staring at all the different countries,

196
00:12:37,502 --> 00:12:40,102
thinking about all the
places I'd travel to someday.

197
00:12:40,248 --> 00:12:43,231
When I got here, I actually started
writing some of those places down.

198
00:12:45,084 --> 00:12:46,658
Everywhere I'd go,

199
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,351
everything I'd see...

200
00:12:52,388 --> 00:12:54,010
... if we ever got to go home.

201
00:12:57,053 --> 00:12:58,594
Let's see it.

202
00:12:58,798 --> 00:13:01,315
Hand it over.

203
00:13:05,765 --> 00:13:07,766
Oh, man. I remember these.

204
00:13:08,644 --> 00:13:11,010
The infamous drug store receipt.

205
00:13:11,544 --> 00:13:12,788
This is quite a list.

206
00:13:12,952 --> 00:13:14,379
I had a lot of time.

207
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,425
Costa Rica, Hawaii...

208
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:20,992
Iceland, nice.

209
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:23,898
Well, have you... have you been?

210
00:13:23,998 --> 00:13:26,132
I hardly got past Grand Rapids.

211
00:13:27,296 --> 00:13:28,757
Always wanted to, though.

212
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:32,552
Well, maybe...

213
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,082
if this radio thing works, maybe...

214
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:39,014
maybe we could go...

215
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:40,753
together.

216
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:43,227
Uh...

217
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:45,260
It doesn't have to be
Iceland. I mean, there's...

218
00:13:45,286 --> 00:13:47,721
there's a lot of choices
on that list, you know?

219
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:49,029
Yeah.

220
00:13:51,612 --> 00:13:52,954
Look, Kenny...

221
00:13:56,786 --> 00:13:57,874
I like you...

222
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,537
a lot.

223
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:07,529
But...

224
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:11,819
I'm engaged.

225
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:18,996
You know that.

226
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:21,159
No. Right. I-I do.

227
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:22,641
Uh,

228
00:14:23,674 --> 00:14:25,130
no, I get it. I shouldn't...

229
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,121
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have, uh...

230
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,916
I-I'm gonna...

231
00:14:30,164 --> 00:14:33,219
I'm gonna take this first
batch of wires up to the house

232
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:36,286
because they're probably
itching to get started.

233
00:14:36,463 --> 00:14:38,258
Um, I'll see you up there.

234
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:39,899
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:41,830
Okay.

236
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:43,903
Okay.

237
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,769
Ah, bit of a wreck, but

238
00:15:00,293 --> 00:15:02,213
you should be able to find something
in there that'll do the trick.

239
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,861
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

240
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:05,838
Gimme a holler if you need anything.

241
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:06,900
Okay.

242
00:15:08,035 --> 00:15:09,035
Hey,

243
00:15:09,423 --> 00:15:11,180
how come you're not up
there at the Colony House

244
00:15:11,191 --> 00:15:12,322
with everyone else?

245
00:15:13,614 --> 00:15:15,693
You mean why aren't I
working on the magic tower

246
00:15:15,732 --> 00:15:17,078
that's gonna bring everybody home?

247
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:18,571
Yeah.

248
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:20,287
You don't think it's gonna work?

249
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:21,964
Ah.

250
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:24,944
Let's just say I've seen a
lot of people with clever ideas

251
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,669
about how they're gonna get out of here.

252
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,051
You wanna know what
they all had in common?

253
00:15:30,274 --> 00:15:31,825
They always end up at the bar.

254
00:15:34,165 --> 00:15:35,647
- Happy hunting.
- Yeah.

255
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:02,109
She said she had some
stuff in the basement...

256
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:07,932
- Hi.
- Hey.

257
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:10,375
Can I talk to you for a second?

258
00:16:10,565 --> 00:16:12,137
Yeah, of course.

259
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,951
Uh, not here. I need
you to come with me.

260
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,807
We have a lot to do here.

261
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,104
Yeah. I know. I know, but
it's... it's important.

262
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,266
Um, yeah. Let me just, um...

263
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,088
Yeah, just put that right
here. We'll be right back, okay?

264
00:16:29,099 --> 00:16:30,703
Come on.

265
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,721
- Ellis, where are we going?
- Just a little further.

266
00:16:44,272 --> 00:16:46,057
All right, and we're here.

267
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,444
We're where?

268
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,756
Well, this is where I was standing

269
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:53,675
the very first moment that I saw you.

270
00:16:54,729 --> 00:16:57,426
You were driving around in
your little Volkswagen Bug,

271
00:16:57,512 --> 00:17:00,430
going around and around for hours.

272
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,752
You hadn't even had
your tires blown out yet,

273
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:04,525
but you pulled over right over there.

274
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:08,435
You stepped outta your
car and looked around.

275
00:17:08,574 --> 00:17:09,983
I remember.

276
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:13,397
I asked Corey for directions.

277
00:17:13,774 --> 00:17:15,271
Yeah.

278
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:19,484
What are we doing?

279
00:17:19,676 --> 00:17:21,364
Well...

280
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:25,246
I've been thinking a lot...

281
00:17:26,282 --> 00:17:27,820
about what you said,

282
00:17:28,442 --> 00:17:30,123
about going home,

283
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:32,360
about who we'd be,

284
00:17:33,048 --> 00:17:35,245
and, you know, I realized something -

285
00:17:36,832 --> 00:17:38,910
I don't even remember anymore

286
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:41,543
who I was before you
stepped out of that car.

287
00:17:43,822 --> 00:17:46,180
And I don't want to find
out who I am without you.

288
00:17:49,244 --> 00:17:50,607
Ellis.

289
00:17:59,142 --> 00:18:00,974
You are the love of my life.

290
00:18:03,493 --> 00:18:06,115
And we could be anywhere.

291
00:18:06,142 --> 00:18:07,710
I mean, we could be
here, we could be there,

292
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:09,768
we could be anywhere in the world,

293
00:18:09,804 --> 00:18:12,243
but it would not matter
because you are my home.

294
00:18:14,665 --> 00:18:16,835
And I would really like to be yours.

295
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:28,188
I love you.

296
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,266
Okay, wait. Is there a "but" coming?

297
00:18:37,702 --> 00:18:39,268
There's no "but."

298
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:41,599
Okay, um...

299
00:18:43,928 --> 00:18:45,205
Here.

300
00:18:46,006 --> 00:18:50,360
So, unfortunately, all of
the jewelry shops were closed,

301
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,500
but I got you this really
stylish piece of wire.

302
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,127
Is that from my pile?

303
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,284
Yes.

304
00:19:07,005 --> 00:19:09,016
Hey. What... what's wrong?

305
00:19:11,854 --> 00:19:14,005
Your dad's gonna be really happy.

306
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:27,316
Where are we going?

307
00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:29,586
Well, the light came
from this direction.

308
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:33,053
So, we're just marching towards it?

309
00:19:33,602 --> 00:19:35,957
Yeah, that's it.

310
00:19:36,673 --> 00:19:38,716
Do you think that's a good idea?

311
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,364
You got a better one?

312
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:42,216
Did you even hear
what I said last night?

313
00:19:42,243 --> 00:19:45,361
- Yeah, I heard you.
- Will you just stop, please?

314
00:19:45,454 --> 00:19:46,771
Look.

315
00:19:47,094 --> 00:19:49,337
Look, we got dragged out
into the middle of nowhere

316
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:51,884
by God knows what.

317
00:19:51,944 --> 00:19:54,691
I-I don't even know which
direction is back to town.

318
00:19:54,763 --> 00:19:56,820
All I do know is that
someone shined a light

319
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,304
from that direction.

320
00:19:58,434 --> 00:19:59,797
And that wasn't a flashlight.

321
00:19:59,827 --> 00:20:02,173
That was a floodlight,
maybe a searchlight,

322
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:04,973
which means that maybe
there's someone or something

323
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:06,640
out this way that can help us.

324
00:20:06,699 --> 00:20:08,314
So we're going that way.

325
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:11,443
And what if whoever it
is doesn't want to help?

326
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:13,858
Then we got a different
kind of problem on our hands.

327
00:20:16,326 --> 00:20:19,704
The voice I heard last
night, it was different.

328
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:22,417
- It wasn't like the others.
- Yeah, you said.

329
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,308
Who is Mr. Fish and Loaves?

330
00:20:28,068 --> 00:20:29,444
It's me.

331
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:31,488
Mr. Fish and Loaves -

332
00:20:31,508 --> 00:20:34,346
it's a nickname I had
back in the service.

333
00:20:35,332 --> 00:20:37,358
Only two people who would've
known that name is Ellis...

334
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:38,533
And your wife.

335
00:20:40,518 --> 00:20:41,630
Yeah.

336
00:20:43,736 --> 00:20:45,836
Do you think she...

337
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,171
What are you asking me?

338
00:20:49,766 --> 00:20:52,532
Did my dead wife send you a message?

339
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:53,902
Is that what you wanna know?

340
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,059
You brought me out here because
you thought I could help.

341
00:20:56,072 --> 00:20:58,223
Okay? Look where we are!

342
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:01,650
Whoever or whatever that voice
was, it told us to go back.

343
00:21:01,671 --> 00:21:04,085
It told us what would
happen if we stayed out here.

344
00:21:04,112 --> 00:21:06,726
- Well, unless it told you which direction to...
- Help!

345
00:21:07,573 --> 00:21:09,679
Boyd, what's wrong?

346
00:21:09,896 --> 00:21:12,225
Someone please, help me!

347
00:21:13,674 --> 00:21:15,057
Boyd?

348
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,883
Hello?

349
00:21:18,815 --> 00:21:20,370
Where are you? Keep talking!

350
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,784
Boyd, who are you talking to?

351
00:21:22,837 --> 00:21:24,676
I'm over here. Help!

352
00:21:24,914 --> 00:21:26,396
Where? I can't...

353
00:21:30,918 --> 00:21:33,118
Boyd, stop! What are you doing?

354
00:21:33,138 --> 00:21:34,356
Shh!

355
00:21:41,494 --> 00:21:42,732
Abby?

356
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,877
Abby? Babe?

357
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:52,390
No, no! No!

358
00:21:52,734 --> 00:21:54,606
No! No!

359
00:21:57,723 --> 00:21:59,959
Ahh! Ayy!

360
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,564
Ahh!

361
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:11,121
Ugh! God!

362
00:22:13,271 --> 00:22:15,527
Wait! Oh!

363
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,946
What the... ? Ow!

364
00:22:20,224 --> 00:22:22,535
- Ahh! Get it...
- I got it! I got it!

365
00:22:23,105 --> 00:22:24,406
Ahh...

366
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,721
What did you see?

367
00:22:37,865 --> 00:22:39,334
Nothing.

368
00:22:39,936 --> 00:22:41,259
Nothing.

369
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,442
Hey, guys.

370
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,660
How are you gonna get it up there?

371
00:23:00,689 --> 00:23:02,138
Well, we're gonna hoist it.

372
00:23:06,207 --> 00:23:09,124
Yeah, see, once we get the
antennae up on the roof,

373
00:23:09,282 --> 00:23:12,502
they'll be tall enough to broadcast
a signal out over the treetops.

374
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,979
Cool.

375
00:23:23,898 --> 00:23:25,201
You okay?

376
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,427
Yeah, I'm good.

377
00:23:29,689 --> 00:23:32,287
I'm gonna go inside and
see if anybody needs help.

378
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,124
I'm here if you need me.

379
00:23:38,828 --> 00:23:40,326
Okay.

380
00:23:40,822 --> 00:23:42,827
I wish Victor was here.

381
00:23:42,876 --> 00:23:45,123
I bet he'd really like this.

382
00:23:45,163 --> 00:23:47,902
Well, I'm sure, wherever
he is, he's okay.

383
00:23:48,398 --> 00:23:49,893
Oh, I know.

384
00:23:50,318 --> 00:23:52,799
He's got to do his part right now.

385
00:23:53,174 --> 00:23:55,927
- His part?
- Of the quest.

386
00:23:56,204 --> 00:23:59,584
He's probably doing something
pretty important right now.

387
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:01,377
That's his part.

388
00:24:01,496 --> 00:24:04,028
Doing this is our part.

389
00:24:06,001 --> 00:24:07,248
That's right.

390
00:24:07,516 --> 00:24:11,507
- Boyd, slow down.
- I'm fine. Just keep moving.

391
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:13,215
We should look at those spider bites.

392
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:16,106
- I said I'm fine.
- No, you're not.

393
00:24:16,146 --> 00:24:17,972
What happened back there?

394
00:24:18,065 --> 00:24:19,395
Don't worry about it.

395
00:24:20,996 --> 00:24:22,959
You heard something, didn't you?

396
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,440
I need you to talk to me, please!

397
00:24:26,572 --> 00:24:28,406
What?

398
00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:30,245
What do you wanna talk about?

399
00:24:30,391 --> 00:24:32,547
You wanna talk about providence?

400
00:24:34,536 --> 00:24:37,539
'Cause there's no way out. Is there?

401
00:24:40,752 --> 00:24:43,088
This fucking place!

402
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:44,933
This place...

403
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:48,594
fucking makes you think that
you're doing the right thing.

404
00:24:48,724 --> 00:24:50,851
It gives you hope, then it...

405
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:54,817
then it takes it away, like
it's feeding on your pain.

406
00:24:55,052 --> 00:24:57,777
You want to feed on my
pain? You want my pain?

407
00:24:58,088 --> 00:24:59,576
You want fuckin' pain?!

408
00:24:59,603 --> 00:25:01,898
You want my fuckin'
pain?! Come on! Get it!

409
00:25:02,037 --> 00:25:04,915
I... I'm waiting!

410
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:06,451
Guys!

411
00:25:07,352 --> 00:25:09,224
Boyd...

412
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:11,533
Ah!

413
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:13,577
Shit.

414
00:25:14,537 --> 00:25:16,758
- What's wrong?
- Ah!

415
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:20,016
I don't know! My head's...

416
00:25:20,192 --> 00:25:22,547
I mean, I don't feel right, not...

417
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,817
Goddamn spider bites!

418
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:26,412
Fucking...

419
00:25:28,707 --> 00:25:30,765
Hey, we have to keep moving.

420
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:33,902
Jeez, where? Huh?

421
00:25:33,935 --> 00:25:35,642
- I don't know.
- Where? Tell me.

422
00:25:36,462 --> 00:25:39,035
Towards the light. Remember?

423
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:42,495
- We have to get towards the light.
- Hey, fuck the lights!

424
00:25:42,515 --> 00:25:44,381
There's no way outta here.

425
00:25:45,056 --> 00:25:46,525
The voice you heard
in your head is right:

426
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:48,106
we're gonna die out here.

427
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:51,546
Then, you're never
gonna see your son again.

428
00:25:52,995 --> 00:25:54,529
Is that what you want?

429
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,233
Okay.

430
00:26:01,781 --> 00:26:03,277
Okay.

431
00:26:03,614 --> 00:26:06,155
Come on. What?

432
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,547
Let me help you.

433
00:26:21,386 --> 00:26:22,616
Yeah.

434
00:26:23,007 --> 00:26:24,953
Come on.

435
00:26:25,469 --> 00:26:27,169
Hold up.

436
00:26:29,895 --> 00:26:31,610
A storm is coming.

437
00:26:32,978 --> 00:26:34,917
Then we better move quick.

438
00:26:35,744 --> 00:26:37,964
All right, we're good. Bring it up.

439
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:01,081
Where are you headed?

440
00:27:01,915 --> 00:27:04,257
- What?
- Where are you going?

441
00:27:04,343 --> 00:27:07,466
Uh, I'm just gonna help
bring up the rest of the wire.

442
00:27:08,022 --> 00:27:10,198
No, they already brought
the last batch up.

443
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:15,857
Right. Um,

444
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,169
fine. I'm going to
get my rolling papers.

445
00:27:18,264 --> 00:27:19,528
Sorry, rolling paper!

446
00:27:19,544 --> 00:27:22,051
I've got one left and I've
been saving it. Okay, Dad?

447
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,447
Is that all right with you?

448
00:27:24,967 --> 00:27:28,490
I know how offensive
you find my proclivities!

449
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:31,089
Whatever.

450
00:27:49,592 --> 00:27:51,769
Oh, I didn't realize you'd be here.

451
00:27:53,043 --> 00:27:55,881
I, uh... I left something in my bedroom.

452
00:28:08,097 --> 00:28:09,426
So, uh...

453
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,787
we might be going home.

454
00:28:15,891 --> 00:28:16,891
Home?

455
00:28:18,758 --> 00:28:20,325
That's pretty exciting, right?

456
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:25,811
It's just you don't seem very excited.

457
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,082
You know,

458
00:28:33,238 --> 00:28:36,500
I grew up in France with my grandma.

459
00:28:40,655 --> 00:28:42,610
She died when I was 12.

460
00:28:42,741 --> 00:28:44,207
I had to come back to the States,

461
00:28:45,107 --> 00:28:46,457
live with my uncle.

462
00:28:50,474 --> 00:28:52,909
I had to, uh... I had to
ride on the plane by myself

463
00:28:52,968 --> 00:28:54,201
because there was, um...

464
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:56,895
there was no one to...

465
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,181
you know.

466
00:29:01,504 --> 00:29:02,848
And I didn't want to go.

467
00:29:02,976 --> 00:29:04,980
I mean, I didn't want to leave France

468
00:29:05,612 --> 00:29:06,935
because...

469
00:29:08,438 --> 00:29:09,883
she...

470
00:29:12,788 --> 00:29:15,276
She didn't have any other
family who lived there.

471
00:29:20,171 --> 00:29:21,823
I didn't want to leave her alone.

472
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:28,412
I mean, she was dead, but...

473
00:29:34,445 --> 00:29:36,834
I was crying at the airport, and...

474
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:40,660
this nice lady bought me a soda.

475
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:42,185
I told her what was wrong.

476
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:46,938
And she, um...

477
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,680
She said to me...

478
00:29:53,866 --> 00:29:55,115
She said to me,

479
00:29:57,497 --> 00:29:59,074
they come with you

480
00:30:00,847 --> 00:30:02,086
when you go.

481
00:30:14,889 --> 00:30:16,371
So I guess...

482
00:30:16,461 --> 00:30:18,276
I guess what I'm just
trying to say is...

483
00:30:22,436 --> 00:30:23,860
don't be sad...

484
00:30:27,745 --> 00:30:29,306
and don't feel guilty.

485
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,299
He'll come with you when you go.

486
00:30:57,466 --> 00:30:59,435
You pray with me?

487
00:31:00,478 --> 00:31:01,793
Okay.

488
00:31:17,998 --> 00:31:20,023
So, take the screwdriver,

489
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:22,987
and we touch it to the coil,

490
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,151
and that's what
determines the frequency.

491
00:31:25,753 --> 00:31:28,599
Now, if I move it along the coil,

492
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:31,477
that's kinda like changing the channel.

493
00:31:31,861 --> 00:31:33,738
And that would connect to this?

494
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,479
Yeah.

495
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:38,075
- Cool.
- Jim?

496
00:31:38,327 --> 00:31:41,218
- They're ready for the top up there.
- Oh, uh,

497
00:31:41,661 --> 00:31:43,096
yeah, let me just check the, uh...

498
00:31:43,127 --> 00:31:46,055
Hey people, we got snacks!

499
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,404
How we doing?

500
00:31:48,494 --> 00:31:51,305
- How are you doing?
- Uh, I'm fine. I got waylaid.

501
00:31:51,427 --> 00:31:52,512
Are you happy?

502
00:31:52,513 --> 00:31:54,491
Just get up on the roof.
We're about to start.

503
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:56,386
Oh, wait a second.

504
00:32:04,595 --> 00:32:06,892
All right, ding-dongs,
it's almost go time.

505
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:08,990
Anybody fucks this up, you
spend a night in the box.

506
00:32:09,004 --> 00:32:10,804
No one is going in the box.

507
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,821
Whatever. Hey, pass
these out, would you?

508
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:14,636
Okay.

509
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:16,992
Anybody wants it, help yourselves.

510
00:32:17,172 --> 00:32:18,331
Woo!

511
00:32:18,601 --> 00:32:19,770
Ha-ha!

512
00:32:19,797 --> 00:32:23,332
- Hey! Stop! You!
- Stop. Cucumbers are ready!

513
00:32:24,846 --> 00:32:26,617
Jesus Christ.

514
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:32,967
Hey.

515
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:35,839
Hi.

516
00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:40,529
Pretty exciting stuff out there.

517
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:42,593
Yeah.

518
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:47,939
You, uh...

519
00:32:47,991 --> 00:32:49,865
You left your lamp thing.

520
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:51,527
Oh.

521
00:32:51,755 --> 00:32:53,099
Forgot it.

522
00:32:54,183 --> 00:32:55,364
Thanks.

523
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,757
I'm, um...

524
00:32:59,168 --> 00:33:02,214
I'm sorry if I made things weird. I...

525
00:33:02,224 --> 00:33:03,320
No. Just, hold on.

526
00:33:03,383 --> 00:33:06,940
I actually came here to
talk you about something.

527
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:10,019
Okay.

528
00:33:12,152 --> 00:33:13,572
I don't know what to do.

529
00:33:15,932 --> 00:33:19,167
And, uh, that really freaks me out

530
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:24,367
'cause, uh, part of me
really wants to go back

531
00:33:24,407 --> 00:33:25,756
to Michigan one day

532
00:33:25,782 --> 00:33:27,989
and find out the woman I fell
in love with waited for me,

533
00:33:28,889 --> 00:33:30,577
that she's still there, that...

534
00:33:32,723 --> 00:33:34,155
that she didn't move on,

535
00:33:34,938 --> 00:33:38,839
and that we can pick
up where we left off

536
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,005
and get married and...

537
00:33:43,212 --> 00:33:44,909
start our life together.

538
00:33:49,596 --> 00:33:51,099
What does the other part want?

539
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,593
To go to Iceland with the most
amazing guy I met in the most

540
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:58,793
fucked-up place imaginable.

541
00:34:07,147 --> 00:34:09,751
Oh, those two sound
like pretty good options.

542
00:34:10,371 --> 00:34:11,636
Yeah.

543
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,092
What are you gonna do?

544
00:34:24,514 --> 00:34:25,725
I don't know.

545
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:33,951
All right, guys, you ready up there?

546
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:37,110
Yep. Uh, just hold on a second!

547
00:34:37,153 --> 00:34:38,656
I wanna see this. Wait!

548
00:34:46,971 --> 00:34:48,447
- Hey!
- Hey.

549
00:34:48,855 --> 00:34:50,056
You guys set?

550
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,089
All right, we're good!

551
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,736
All right, you ready?

552
00:34:57,001 --> 00:34:59,626
- Let 'er rip.
- Lift off!

553
00:34:59,668 --> 00:35:02,286
- Lift off.
- All right. Liftoff, guys. Come on.

554
00:35:02,564 --> 00:35:04,635
Here you go. Ready?

555
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,115
Come on! Come on.

556
00:35:08,227 --> 00:35:09,875
That's it, nice and easy.

557
00:35:10,168 --> 00:35:11,691
That's it, that's it!

558
00:35:12,502 --> 00:35:14,042
There we go.

559
00:35:19,363 --> 00:35:22,267
Nice and easy. Slowly.

560
00:35:24,563 --> 00:35:26,271
We're secure!

561
00:35:31,067 --> 00:35:33,746
Come here. All right. Good job.

562
00:35:33,812 --> 00:35:36,338
All right, now it's time to see
if this thing will actually work.

563
00:35:36,629 --> 00:35:38,012
It's gonna work. It's gonna work.

564
00:35:38,065 --> 00:35:40,414
Okay, everybody, that's
you! Go, go, go, go!

565
00:35:41,903 --> 00:35:43,358
All right.

566
00:35:46,456 --> 00:35:48,032
Okay!

567
00:35:48,308 --> 00:35:49,817
On three.

568
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:52,477
One, two...

569
00:35:52,549 --> 00:35:53,939
- Come on!
- ... three!

570
00:35:53,978 --> 00:35:55,706
Come on. Let's go.

571
00:35:57,002 --> 00:35:58,913
Oh, my God. Don't touch it.

572
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,138
It's working.

573
00:36:07,813 --> 00:36:11,447
We got power! We got a signal!

574
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:14,032
Yes! Ah! Come on!

575
00:36:14,211 --> 00:36:16,104
Yes!

576
00:36:18,323 --> 00:36:20,962
Come here, baby!

577
00:36:21,081 --> 00:36:23,351
- Yes!
- Hey, listen!

578
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,758
If you guys are all done
stroking each other down there,

579
00:36:27,003 --> 00:36:29,649
you might wanna start
transmitting sometime today!

580
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:34,003
Hey, I am so proud of you.

581
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:37,675
But I have to go now.

582
00:36:37,774 --> 00:36:40,084
- What?
- Plan B!

583
00:36:42,692 --> 00:36:44,705
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

584
00:36:49,277 --> 00:36:51,269
All right, come here. You wanna do it?

585
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,266
No. You do it. You do it. You do it.

586
00:36:55,882 --> 00:36:57,216
Hey!

587
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:00,148
You see those clouds out there?

588
00:37:06,922 --> 00:37:08,814
Motherfucker.

589
00:37:09,972 --> 00:37:11,751
We should find shelter.

590
00:37:12,486 --> 00:37:14,881
Once we get up the hill, we...

591
00:37:15,641 --> 00:37:18,420
Okay, I just...

592
00:37:19,326 --> 00:37:21,100
You go ahead.

593
00:37:21,735 --> 00:37:24,204
I... I just need to sit a minute.

594
00:37:24,415 --> 00:37:26,162
No sitting.

595
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,564
We keep moving. Come on.

596
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,317
We're almost over the hill.

597
00:37:30,509 --> 00:37:32,249
I can't...

598
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,736
You hear that?

599
00:37:35,531 --> 00:37:37,568
We're going in the right
direction. We just...

600
00:37:41,418 --> 00:37:43,390
We just need to keep going.

601
00:37:44,382 --> 00:37:45,910
Almost there.

602
00:37:49,383 --> 00:37:51,209
Almost there.

603
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:31,690
Right here, on this one. On top, on top.

604
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:33,331
Remember? That's it.

605
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:37,480
Mayday. Mayday.

606
00:38:37,572 --> 00:38:40,436
Can anyone out there hear
me? This is an SOS call.

607
00:38:40,509 --> 00:38:42,229
We need help. Mayday.

608
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:49,878
Right, next one.

609
00:38:52,108 --> 00:38:55,483
Mayday. Mayday. Can
anyone out there hear me?

610
00:38:55,529 --> 00:38:58,023
This is an SOS call. We need help.

611
00:38:58,215 --> 00:38:59,644
Mayday.

612
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,703
Next one.

613
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,460
Mayday. Mayday. Can
anybody out there hear me?

614
00:39:11,493 --> 00:39:14,364
This is an SOS call. Mayday.

615
00:39:14,446 --> 00:39:16,327
That storm's coming in pretty quick.

616
00:39:16,347 --> 00:39:18,272
You need to pack it in,
start again tomorrow.

617
00:39:18,325 --> 00:39:19,820
Why don't we just give
it a few more minutes?

618
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,765
You have got about ten minutes

619
00:39:21,805 --> 00:39:25,336
before the wind blows that
goddamn tower off the roof.

620
00:39:25,384 --> 00:39:26,999
You need to get your boy inside.

621
00:39:28,315 --> 00:39:29,923
All right. Go in the house.

622
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:31,855
- I wanna stay.
- Listen to me. Go in the house.

623
00:39:31,888 --> 00:39:33,065
I'll be in in a few minutes, okay?

624
00:39:33,087 --> 00:39:34,622
Everything's fine. Hand it over.

625
00:39:36,284 --> 00:39:38,227
Go on. It's gonna be okay.

626
00:39:41,874 --> 00:39:43,116
Here, give me that.

627
00:39:43,124 --> 00:39:45,282
- All right, what you gotta do...
- Yeah, I know.

628
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:48,705
Remember, we lose this radio,
and the whole thing's done.

629
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,598
Mayday. Mayday.

630
00:39:57,644 --> 00:40:00,324
Is anybody out there?
Does anybody read me?

631
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:02,417
This is an SOS call. Mayday.

632
00:40:03,983 --> 00:40:06,074
Oh, Jim, we need to stop!

633
00:40:06,603 --> 00:40:09,978
Fuck! Ugh. All right, um...

634
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,751
Hello?

635
00:40:12,373 --> 00:40:14,676
Hello? Is there someone there?

636
00:40:15,694 --> 00:40:18,143
Uh, yes, yes, we're here!

637
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:20,810
Uh... Oh, my God, you
have no idea, um...

638
00:40:20,843 --> 00:40:22,576
Oh, Jesus.

639
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:24,858
Uh, listen, we don't
have very much time.

640
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:26,612
Where are you?

641
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:29,972
Whoa, whoa, slow down. Is this Jim?

642
00:40:32,168 --> 00:40:33,564
Sorry. What?

643
00:40:33,622 --> 00:40:35,642
Jim Matthews?

644
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,347
Who is this?

645
00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:43,528
Your wife shouldn't be
digging that hole, Jim.

646
00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:48,431
Watch my kids.

647
00:40:48,497 --> 00:40:50,256
Watch my kids!

648
00:40:50,812 --> 00:40:52,651
- Where's he going?
- I don't know.

649
00:40:52,697 --> 00:40:54,609
Move! Hey, what happened?

650
00:40:54,636 --> 00:40:56,542
- Where's he going?
- He, um...

651
00:40:56,614 --> 00:40:58,169
Donna, what happened?

652
00:41:32,024 --> 00:41:33,899
What the fuck?

653
00:41:47,116 --> 00:41:48,803
You're here.

654
00:41:52,919 --> 00:41:54,920
He said that you would come.

655
00:41:55,665 --> 00:41:56,988
What?

656
00:41:57,028 --> 00:41:58,523
The Boy in White.

657
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,632
He said that you would
come, that I should wait.

658
00:42:07,197 --> 00:42:08,586
We have to go.

659
00:42:09,215 --> 00:42:10,719
It's not safe here.

660
00:42:11,544 --> 00:42:13,430
This is where they sleep.

661
00:42:14,217 --> 00:42:15,540
What?

662
00:42:16,072 --> 00:42:17,750
You see?

663
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,820
They make drawings too.

664
00:42:25,127 --> 00:42:26,662
Oh, my God.

665
00:42:29,626 --> 00:42:30,870
We have to go.

666
00:42:30,922 --> 00:42:32,867
We have to go now!

667
00:42:33,568 --> 00:42:35,169
Now!

668
00:42:38,543 --> 00:42:40,283
Tabitha!

669
00:42:45,536 --> 00:42:47,362
Tabitha!

670
00:43:02,321 --> 00:43:04,425
Tabitha!

671
00:43:07,495 --> 00:43:09,255
Boyd? Boyd!

672
00:43:09,315 --> 00:43:12,389
- Go!
- No, I'm not leaving you here.

673
00:43:13,919 --> 00:43:15,123
Ah!

674
00:43:15,196 --> 00:43:17,021
Hey. Hey, hey!

675
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:18,444
Listen to me!

676
00:43:18,649 --> 00:43:20,296
If you don't go...

677
00:43:21,871 --> 00:43:23,776
- we are both gonna die.
- No.

678
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,825
Listen! Listen to me.

679
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:28,637
One of us has gotta get outta here.

680
00:43:28,862 --> 00:43:32,647
One of us has gotta go
back and tell the others.

681
00:43:34,003 --> 00:43:36,782
We can both go back. We can.

682
00:43:36,888 --> 00:43:38,615
We just need to find shelter.

683
00:43:38,661 --> 00:43:41,314
- Sara...
- I'm not leaving you here!

684
00:43:41,367 --> 00:43:43,377
Sara, look up.

685
00:43:45,265 --> 00:43:47,488
Nathan was right about this place.

686
00:43:48,129 --> 00:43:51,226
It's angry now. You have to get inside.

687
00:43:51,418 --> 00:43:52,847
Over there.

688
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,518
You'll be safe in there.

689
00:43:56,399 --> 00:43:58,966
The tree. The tree! We'll be safe there.

690
00:43:59,032 --> 00:44:00,830
- What are you...
- Just... just trust me!

691
00:44:00,903 --> 00:44:02,484
Please! Oh, fuck!

692
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:03,893
- Good!
- There.

693
00:44:03,946 --> 00:44:06,248
- Good, good, good!
- There.

694
00:44:09,623 --> 00:44:11,297
- Get in.
- What?

695
00:44:11,462 --> 00:44:15,064
- We have to get inside. We'll be safe in there.
- How do you...

696
00:44:15,845 --> 00:44:17,628
I'll be right behind you.

697
00:44:23,852 --> 00:44:25,676
I'll follow behind...

698
00:44:30,499 --> 00:44:32,279
Sara, what...

699
00:44:43,466 --> 00:44:45,034
Hey, hello?

700
00:44:47,702 --> 00:44:49,347
Hello?

701
00:44:49,943 --> 00:44:52,533
Hey!

702
00:44:52,663 --> 00:44:55,318
Hey! Hello?!

703
00:44:55,449 --> 00:44:57,426
Can anybody hear me?!

704
00:44:57,584 --> 00:45:01,343
Help! Hey. Hey!

705
00:45:01,468 --> 00:45:03,065
Hey! Hello?!

706
00:45:03,195 --> 00:45:04,762
Hey!
