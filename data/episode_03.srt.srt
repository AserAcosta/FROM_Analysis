00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:19,044
Previously on From.

2
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:21,271
What the fuck?

3
00:00:22,248 --> 00:00:24,911
Kenny! You gotta come down here!

4
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:28,431
There's enough food here to feed
everybody in the entire town!

5
00:00:28,457 --> 00:00:30,666
You think this place can't break you?

6
00:00:30,692 --> 00:00:31,948
Let's see.

7
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:34,322
What the fuck?! No, no, no, no, no!

8
00:00:34,427 --> 00:00:36,887
You were in the barn with
her with those things.

9
00:00:36,998 --> 00:00:38,850
How are you still alive?

10
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:40,615
They wanted me to watch.

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,276
- Kenny.
- Wait. Where's... where's my mom?

12
00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:46,046
- Bud, I'm s...
- No! Stop! Just stop.

13
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,432
- We need more information.
- Yeah.

14
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:53,961
I'm gonna need
your help with something tomorrow.

15
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,359
With what?

16
00:00:55,905 --> 00:00:58,023
We're gonna catch one of
these fucking things.

17
00:00:58,142 --> 00:00:59,703
You're gonna have a baby

18
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:02,219
that you were told you could never have!

19
00:01:02,245 --> 00:01:03,680
With all you've seen,

20
00:01:03,706 --> 00:01:05,808
you can't wrap your
head around a miracle.

21
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:07,641
You're severely malnourished.

22
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,811
We really just need to
get you eating again.

23
00:01:09,876 --> 00:01:11,310
Are those the crops?

24
00:01:11,336 --> 00:01:13,040
Yeah. We figured we'd
try composting them,

25
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:15,109
see if we can't get the
soil turned around.

26
00:01:17,335 --> 00:01:18,714
- Jade?
- I can't...

27
00:01:18,977 --> 00:01:19,977
I can't see it.

28
00:01:20,102 --> 00:01:22,750
Fuck. I can't see it.

29
00:01:23,696 --> 00:01:25,571
You ready to tell me
what's going on with you?

30
00:01:25,597 --> 00:01:27,516
Still kinda working it out for myself.

31
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:30,881
Do you remember the bracelet I made you?

32
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:32,258
You're saying you found a bracelet

33
00:01:32,283 --> 00:01:34,797
- that's similar to the one you made?
- No, no, no, no, no. It's not similar.

34
00:01:34,823 --> 00:01:37,438
- That is the bracelet.
- It's impossible.

35
00:01:37,674 --> 00:01:39,693
Visit the bottle tree.

36
00:01:39,757 --> 00:01:42,564
My mother said this one would
take her to the tower,

37
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,025
to the children.

38
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:46,524
Miranda started seeing things.

39
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,107
She painted everything she saw.

40
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:52,152
She said it was like she'd been chosen

41
00:01:52,177 --> 00:01:54,422
to free the children.

42
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,477
I guess you've been chosen now, too.

43
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,994
When Thomas died, you
and Mom fell apart,

44
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,829
and there was no one there for Ethan.

45
00:02:01,854 --> 00:02:04,114
I need you to get your shit together.

46
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,307
Okay.

47
00:02:09,064 --> 00:02:10,211
Hello?

48
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,946
Dad? It's Thomas.

49
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:23,381
Daddy, are you there?

50
00:02:24,527 --> 00:02:26,521
You are not my son.

51
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:28,701
Why did you let Mommy go?

52
00:02:30,168 --> 00:02:32,478
Why did you want her to die?

53
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,982
Stop it!

54
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:36,482
Is it because you didn't
love her anymore?

55
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:39,123
What do you want?

56
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:40,560
To help.

57
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:42,857
You need help, Daddy.

58
00:02:42,883 --> 00:02:44,651
Stop calling me that.

59
00:02:44,855 --> 00:02:47,374
You should be watching Julie and Ethan.

60
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:50,576
You shouldn't let them play
outside so close to dark.

61
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:56,310
Daddy, are you there?

62
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,817
Ethan!

63
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:12,238
Julie!

64
00:03:15,724 --> 00:03:17,675
Ethan! Julie!

65
00:03:18,884 --> 00:03:20,113
Ethan!

66
00:03:22,157 --> 00:03:23,386
Julie!

67
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:24,709
What?

68
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:26,211
What are you doing?

69
00:03:26,237 --> 00:03:27,847
Feeding the animals!

70
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:29,581
Come on inside!

71
00:03:30,363 --> 00:03:31,425
Ethan!

72
00:03:31,706 --> 00:03:34,313
- We're not done yet!
- Hey, Ethan! I said right now! Come on!

73
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,456
Jim!

74
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,370
You okay?

75
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:39,792
Yeah. You know, I'm talking to my kids.

76
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:41,386
Come on. Ethan.

77
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:44,050
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- We're coming.

78
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,058
- It's gonna be dark soon.
- I know.

79
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,257
- They okay?
- Yeah.

80
00:03:55,885 --> 00:03:56,980
Sorry.

81
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:02,214
Things are getting worse
around here, aren't they?

82
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:07,675
Yeah.

83
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:31,377
www.subtitulamos.tv

84
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:33,385
Wha?

85
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,697
Easy now. You'll cut yourself.

86
00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:42,244
Told you.

87
00:06:45,744 --> 00:06:47,260
Were you down there all night?

88
00:06:47,286 --> 00:06:49,353
You need to sleep.

89
00:06:54,628 --> 00:06:57,017
I need answers.

90
00:06:57,603 --> 00:06:59,459
There has to be something
in that basement,

91
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:01,838
in those paintings that I'm missing.

92
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:04,650
I got some bandages in here somewhere.

93
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:07,955
There we are.

94
00:07:08,814 --> 00:07:10,916
- Help me, please.
- Oh, no, no. It's all right.

95
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:17,094
So, that boy,

96
00:07:17,252 --> 00:07:19,869
the one dressed in white,

97
00:07:19,895 --> 00:07:22,181
you're saying that he lured you

98
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:24,314
up to the top of a lighthouse

99
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,569
and then pushed you out?

100
00:07:26,595 --> 00:07:28,119
No, no, no, no, no. He didn't lure me.

101
00:07:28,145 --> 00:07:31,456
I just went there because
of, you know, the children.

102
00:07:31,814 --> 00:07:34,077
Children locked in the tower.

103
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,174
Yeah. You see...

104
00:07:37,736 --> 00:07:40,150
the tower was actually a lighthouse,

105
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:41,919
and in order to get there,

106
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:43,549
I had to go through a tree.

107
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:45,675
Victor took me there.

108
00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:47,796
He said his mother had gone off

109
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:50,322
to save the children as
well, the night she...

110
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,502
- she...
- It's all right.

111
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:55,161
You can say it.

112
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:58,905
I, accepted the fact that she died

113
00:07:58,931 --> 00:08:01,150
a long, long time ago.

114
00:08:01,177 --> 00:08:02,767
I thought they all had.

115
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:08,119
The fact that Victor is still
out there somewhere, it's...

116
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:17,356
Do you hear that?

117
00:08:18,644 --> 00:08:20,121
Oh, the bottles.

118
00:08:20,147 --> 00:08:21,809
Of course I hear them.

119
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:26,114
They're hanging, on a
tree in the backyard.

120
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,067
Miranda used to call it the bottle tree.

121
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:38,114
One, two, three.

122
00:08:42,044 --> 00:08:43,333
Six...

123
00:09:10,323 --> 00:09:12,426
How do you even know
that this is possible?

124
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,593
Yeah. I don't,

125
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:16,164
but the talismans,

126
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:18,791
they keep those things from
getting into the houses.

127
00:09:18,863 --> 00:09:21,169
Maybe it can keep them from
getting out of something.

128
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:22,961
Look. I get it, but we're
not talking about catching

129
00:09:22,987 --> 00:09:24,984
a stray dog or a coyote, okay?

130
00:09:25,016 --> 00:09:27,566
Those things, we don't
know anything about them.

131
00:09:27,591 --> 00:09:29,609
Yeah. Well, maybe it's time we learned.

132
00:09:29,795 --> 00:09:32,439
We can't just sit around
playing it safe anymore.

133
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:33,961
"Safe."

134
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,950
You spent one night out in the forest,

135
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:38,625
and it almost got you killed.

136
00:09:38,664 --> 00:09:41,052
And then it almost got
everybody killed, but "safe."

137
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:42,914
Jim and Kenny spent the night
out in the forest, right?

138
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,036
And they came back with food,

139
00:09:44,062 --> 00:09:46,700
and now, we have enough food
to feed everyone again.

140
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:47,888
The point is,

141
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:50,555
it's not always gonna work out
the way that we want it to,

142
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:52,819
but that doesn't mean
we can't take chances.

143
00:09:53,816 --> 00:09:55,352
I'm with you, okay?

144
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:56,544
I...

145
00:09:58,476 --> 00:10:00,494
How'd it go with, Kenny and the others?

146
00:10:00,847 --> 00:10:03,936
Fine. We all drew straws,
Dale threw a shit-fit,

147
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:05,888
and they all went on their way.

148
00:10:06,393 --> 00:10:08,380
Should be down there by lunchtime.

149
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:11,380
And how did Kenny seem?

150
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:13,880
As good as can be expected.

151
00:10:14,974 --> 00:10:16,333
Kristi's down there with them.

152
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:17,370
Good.

153
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:19,076
Yeah.

154
00:10:22,377 --> 00:10:23,497
All right.

155
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:26,302
What the fuck's going on?

156
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:33,964
Okay. If you don't tell her, I will.

157
00:10:38,286 --> 00:10:40,164
I wanna catch one of those things.

158
00:10:41,777 --> 00:10:43,188
Sorry. What?

159
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,672
Those things show up every night,

160
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:47,978
every goddamn night,

161
00:10:48,004 --> 00:10:50,586
and we still have no idea
what we're dealing with,

162
00:10:50,838 --> 00:10:53,649
what they are, where they come from.

163
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,640
Boyd, we have been down this road.

164
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,030
You have already caught one.

165
00:10:57,055 --> 00:10:58,782
No. I killed one.

166
00:10:58,807 --> 00:11:00,024
That's different.

167
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:02,117
We need to learn about them.

168
00:11:02,914 --> 00:11:04,704
We already know they talk,

169
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:07,513
so we catch one, we make it talk.

170
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:08,833
Oh, you're gonna make it talk.

171
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:11,555
How are you gonna do that?
You gonna torture it?

172
00:11:11,814 --> 00:11:16,126
We have hit those things
point blank with shotguns,

173
00:11:16,152 --> 00:11:18,254
and all it makes them do is smile!

174
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,555
They are not human.

175
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:21,721
Well, according to Kristi,
they were at some point!

176
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:23,473
Oh, and what part of that reassures you?

177
00:11:23,498 --> 00:11:26,000
- We gotta do something, all
right? You can't... - Dad.

178
00:11:26,618 --> 00:11:28,412
We gotta fucking do something.

179
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:32,258
How you gonna do it?

180
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:35,091
I am working on that.

181
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:36,586
Great.

182
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:38,400
Work harder.

183
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:50,983
Look.

184
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:53,868
I miss Tian-Chen, too,

185
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:58,171
and believe me, I do not
want us to not go out there

186
00:11:58,204 --> 00:11:59,818
and get our pound of flesh.

187
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,863
But I do not want to
watch you get killed

188
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:05,141
because of some
half-baked, dumbass plan.

189
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:10,030
And don't you encourage him.

190
00:12:12,385 --> 00:12:14,046
You got a baby on the way.

191
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:18,097
You have more to worry
about now than yourself.

192
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:26,196
- Dad...
- No.

193
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:30,129
All right.

194
00:12:33,388 --> 00:12:35,840
- I'll talk to you later.
- Yep. Yep.

195
00:12:49,994 --> 00:12:51,354
What is that?

196
00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:54,269
They divvied up the rest
of the cow this morning.

197
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:56,383
We got plenty, if you want some.

198
00:12:57,388 --> 00:12:58,674
I don't think so.

199
00:12:59,428 --> 00:13:01,393
Baby's not a meat-eater, uh?

200
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,627
I guess not.

201
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:49,966
Well, that's terrifying.

202
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,589
I can't believe people
actually lived out here.

203
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,948
Are we sure they were people?
I mean, look at this.

204
00:14:56,273 --> 00:14:58,354
Just look at how they're positioned.

205
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,448
They may have been using them the
same way we use the talismans,

206
00:15:01,474 --> 00:15:03,784
warding off evil spirits.

207
00:15:03,994 --> 00:15:06,432
Oh, that's much more comforting.

208
00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:09,783
Whatever happened, it
was a long time ago.

209
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,328
We have people back in
town who are hungry now.

210
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:14,547
So, all right, Jim and I pulled

211
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:16,781
and gathered as much as
we could before we left.

212
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:18,124
It's up in that shack over there.

213
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:21,383
So, let's get, get Dale, Jade, Roger.

214
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:22,628
You guys can get started there.

215
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:25,370
The rest of us will go forage
whatever else we can find.

216
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,206
- Let's go! Wasting daylight!
- Great.

217
00:15:28,232 --> 00:15:29,875
- Careful.
- Great.

218
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:32,307
Let's just walk right past
the scary voodoo tower

219
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,096
and go sort some veggies.

220
00:15:45,646 --> 00:15:47,985
I did the best I could
with what we had left.

221
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:53,813
Good news is, when Kenny and the
others get back with the food,

222
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:55,860
we'll be off rations.

223
00:15:56,636 --> 00:15:58,016
Won't that be good?

224
00:15:59,073 --> 00:16:00,524
I guess so.

225
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:05,032
I made some lunch.

226
00:16:05,563 --> 00:16:07,360
- Do you want some?
- No.

227
00:16:07,852 --> 00:16:08,907
All right.

228
00:16:12,177 --> 00:16:13,649
Who's gonna bury her?

229
00:16:14,971 --> 00:16:16,072
What?

230
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:18,001
Who's gonna bury Mom?

231
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:20,954
Don't talk like that.

232
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:23,962
But...

233
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:27,944
what if her body's just laying
out there on the ground

234
00:16:27,969 --> 00:16:29,779
with bugs and spiders?

235
00:16:29,804 --> 00:16:32,866
Will her body just lay there
'til it starts to rot?

236
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:34,305
Ethan.

237
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,203
But what if someone finds her someday,

238
00:16:37,228 --> 00:16:39,438
and they don't know who she is
'cause all they find is bones?

239
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:40,477
Stop!

240
00:16:40,943 --> 00:16:43,883
God damn it! Stop!

241
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:51,688
- I'm sorry. I... - Yeah. Really
gunning for parent of the year.

242
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:21,331
Miranda was an artist.

243
00:17:21,356 --> 00:17:24,834
She did all sorts of
installations all over town.

244
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:27,195
This was always one of her favorites.

245
00:17:27,221 --> 00:17:29,339
You're saying there's
something like this

246
00:17:29,364 --> 00:17:31,445
in that town you came from?

247
00:17:31,471 --> 00:17:34,370
No. This was different.

248
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,784
It's not here.

249
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:40,553
What are you looking for?

250
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:42,987
The tree that Victor took me to had

251
00:17:43,198 --> 00:17:45,885
some sort of, like, opening,

252
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:50,862
you know, one that you
can, like, step in,

253
00:17:51,414 --> 00:17:55,174
and it will just take you somewhere.

254
00:17:55,846 --> 00:17:59,910
So, you would step into the tree,

255
00:17:59,936 --> 00:18:01,885
like teleporting?

256
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:05,487
It doesn't matter. It's just a tree.

257
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,211
Well, it's not the original,

258
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:09,877
if that matters.

259
00:18:10,572 --> 00:18:11,619
What?

260
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:14,815
Like I said, she did
installations all over.

261
00:18:14,841 --> 00:18:18,456
She liked this one so much,
she made a replica for the...

262
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,236
for the yard.

263
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:23,784
Said she wanted it to be close to her.

264
00:18:24,385 --> 00:18:28,752
The original's in a
park a few towns over.

265
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:31,002
In fact...

266
00:18:31,353 --> 00:18:33,001
What? In fact what?

267
00:18:33,136 --> 00:18:37,596
Well, that was where we
dropped acid together.

268
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,207
You could say that tree

269
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:42,924
was where this all started.

270
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:46,165
Oh, my God, and how far is it from here?

271
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,073
- Thirty, 40 minutes.
- Okay. You need to take me there right now.

272
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:50,920
- You need to get some sleep.
- No, no, no, no, no.

273
00:18:50,945 --> 00:18:52,541
You need to take me
there right now, Henry.

274
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:54,591
You're not gonna do
either of us any good

275
00:18:54,616 --> 00:18:57,346
- if you end up back in the hospital.
- I'm not gonna go to the hospital.

276
00:18:57,372 --> 00:18:59,374
I just need to go to the tree.
Please take me. Let's go.

277
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:00,528
Let's go.

278
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:10,002
So, is this some part
of your nefarious plan?

279
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,114
You really think you can
catch one of those things?

280
00:19:18,248 --> 00:19:19,414
Maybe.

281
00:19:23,508 --> 00:19:25,409
Boyd, you've been here, what?

282
00:19:25,771 --> 00:19:27,373
Year and half now?

283
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:31,396
Done pretty well by
most metrics, you know.

284
00:19:31,896 --> 00:19:34,572
You kept most people alive
who'd otherwise be dead.

285
00:19:36,297 --> 00:19:38,451
Present company excluded, of course.

286
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,701
So why change things now?

287
00:19:43,922 --> 00:19:45,315
Look around you.

288
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,998
Look at all the shit
that's happening lately.

289
00:19:47,024 --> 00:19:48,693
You really gotta ask me that?

290
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:54,734
Well, at least you have
a solid plan, right?

291
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:56,800
Lure one of those things into a house.

292
00:19:56,878 --> 00:19:58,810
Slap a talisman on the
outside of the door.

293
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:00,370
Trap it inside.

294
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:02,200
Next day, go over. Go inside.

295
00:20:02,225 --> 00:20:03,737
Wander around the house,

296
00:20:03,763 --> 00:20:05,675
searching for it room by room until

297
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:08,178
it jumps out from somewhere
and rips you to pieces.

298
00:20:08,606 --> 00:20:11,609
Yeah, no, I can see how the military
trusted you to plan things.

299
00:20:14,862 --> 00:20:16,322
You don't see it, do you?

300
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:19,956
Boyd, you can't even see what's
staring you right in the face.

301
00:20:19,982 --> 00:20:21,201
Which is?

302
00:20:21,227 --> 00:20:23,371
Those things said they
wanted to break you,

303
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:25,653
and that means they
wanted to change you.

304
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:29,021
So far, so good, because
the Boyd I knew

305
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:31,128
would never do something
this colossally stupid.

306
00:20:31,154 --> 00:20:33,490
Yeah, well, the Boyd you
knew got you killed.

307
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:37,610
You know, you might wanna get down off of
that cross of yours every now and then.

308
00:20:37,635 --> 00:20:39,737
- You know that?
- You know, fuck you, man.

309
00:20:39,762 --> 00:20:42,107
I died because I was
trying to help people.

310
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:45,670
Tian-Chen, she died because she
was trying to help people.

311
00:20:45,696 --> 00:20:47,715
You have any idea how arrogant it is

312
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:51,115
to diminish that sacrifice by
making this all about you?

313
00:20:51,527 --> 00:20:53,421
But I really like your fancy art.

314
00:20:53,447 --> 00:20:54,498
It's nice.

315
00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:57,373
It's a memory board.

316
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,964
The graveyard has no markers,
no headstones, just bodies.

317
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,498
Probably bodies buried
all over the place.

318
00:21:06,204 --> 00:21:08,053
We should have a place for their names.

319
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:12,467
Your name, Tian-Chen's.

320
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:16,349
You know, I think better
when I work with my hands,

321
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,178
so leave me the fuck alone.

322
00:21:52,731 --> 00:21:53,792
Hi.

323
00:21:54,562 --> 00:21:55,644
Hello.

324
00:21:57,631 --> 00:21:58,933
Do you need something?

325
00:22:00,463 --> 00:22:01,605
Yes.

326
00:22:04,385 --> 00:22:05,956
Do you want to come in?

327
00:22:14,085 --> 00:22:17,147
So, what can I help you with?

328
00:22:17,328 --> 00:22:18,686
What is that?

329
00:22:21,628 --> 00:22:23,405
My brother made it for me.

330
00:22:24,181 --> 00:22:27,178
I don't think I'll ever be able
to put it back together, but...

331
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,585
I like to try.

332
00:22:31,969 --> 00:22:33,568
Do you have a bedspread?

333
00:22:34,911 --> 00:22:37,319
Yeah. I have a few upstairs. Why?

334
00:22:38,571 --> 00:22:40,694
We need to build a fort.

335
00:22:41,498 --> 00:22:43,522
Then I'm gonna tell a story.

336
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:52,416
It's Tillie.

337
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,431
Can I come in?

338
00:22:57,404 --> 00:22:59,845
I'm really not feeling great right now.

339
00:23:04,356 --> 00:23:06,523
I used to lick eggshells.

340
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:11,055
When I was pregnant with my first,

341
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,833
I used to lick the inside of eggshells.

342
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:15,911
Yep.

343
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:18,499
I couldn't stand

344
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:20,619
the sight or the smell
of my favorite foods,

345
00:23:20,645 --> 00:23:23,729
but crack an egg and leave
the shell on the counter...

346
00:23:23,908 --> 00:23:26,902
I would even sneak 'em from the garbage

347
00:23:26,928 --> 00:23:28,722
when my husband wasn't looking.

348
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,010
It started

349
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:37,611
somewhere in my second trimester.

350
00:23:37,966 --> 00:23:39,596
Lasted three weeks

351
00:23:40,134 --> 00:23:43,486
and then stopped
mysteriously as it began.

352
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:46,596
Whatever's going on,

353
00:23:46,746 --> 00:23:48,877
I promise it'll pass.

354
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,156
Yeah, maybe.

355
00:24:05,593 --> 00:24:06,701
It's okay.

356
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:08,638
It's okay.

357
00:24:08,971 --> 00:24:10,341
I can't...

358
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:13,724
I can't talk to anyone.

359
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:18,498
You know what they do here.

360
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:20,359
I'm afraid that they would think...

361
00:24:24,557 --> 00:24:27,094
And Ellis, he's so...

362
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:31,618
He's happy again,

363
00:24:31,723 --> 00:24:33,290
actually happy.

364
00:24:35,524 --> 00:24:36,712
And he's...

365
00:24:37,664 --> 00:24:42,344
he's working so hard, trying
so hard to be encouraging,

366
00:24:42,778 --> 00:24:44,329
and I can't...

367
00:24:47,037 --> 00:24:48,321
Can't what?

368
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,508
I can't tell him how scared I am.

369
00:24:56,915 --> 00:25:00,180
What if there's something
wrong with the baby?

370
00:25:00,206 --> 00:25:01,248
What if...

371
00:25:02,605 --> 00:25:06,186
Every first-time mother
has these feelings.

372
00:25:07,496 --> 00:25:09,725
I'm not supposed to be a mom.

373
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,366
I was never supposed to be one!
I'm not...

374
00:25:14,088 --> 00:25:17,069
I was never supposed to
be able to conceive,

375
00:25:17,665 --> 00:25:21,225
and yet, somehow, here...

376
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:27,296
I just want to know if the
baby's gonna be okay.

377
00:25:31,207 --> 00:25:33,835
Well, then, let's find out.

378
00:25:42,356 --> 00:25:44,150
It's not locked.

379
00:25:49,124 --> 00:25:50,377
Okay.

380
00:26:00,105 --> 00:26:02,166
It does that sometimes.

381
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,659
That tape's been stuck
in there for years.

382
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:07,839
"Blue" was Miranda's favorite song.

383
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,491
Tabitha?

384
00:26:13,061 --> 00:26:14,342
You okay?

385
00:26:14,368 --> 00:26:17,092
Yeah. It's just mine
and my husband's song.

386
00:26:18,889 --> 00:26:20,348
Small world.

387
00:26:32,948 --> 00:26:35,043
I'm telling you, it was rigged.

388
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:39,207
Donna knew exactly who was
gonna draw the short straws.

389
00:26:42,516 --> 00:26:44,576
Wouldn't kill you to give
us a hand, you know.

390
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,129
Fucking guy.

391
00:26:46,403 --> 00:26:48,088
Guy's been losing his shit lately.

392
00:26:48,222 --> 00:26:49,531
Yeah, no kidding.

393
00:26:49,557 --> 00:26:50,942
Dead weight out here.

394
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,902
If you're gonna whisper,

395
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,051
you should try actually whispering.

396
00:26:57,942 --> 00:26:58,981
Look.

397
00:26:59,497 --> 00:27:02,244
Everyone here is having a hard
time, you know. It's not just you.

398
00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:03,575
We're all stuck here,

399
00:27:03,687 --> 00:27:05,247
and you walk around like some big shot

400
00:27:05,272 --> 00:27:07,129
thinks he's smarter than everybody else

401
00:27:07,155 --> 00:27:09,705
because you had some
rinky-dink company back home.

402
00:27:09,731 --> 00:27:12,231
Oh, isn't it such a tragedy
that you're stuck here

403
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:13,661
while the rest of us...

404
00:27:13,687 --> 00:27:15,997
Oh, will you shut the fuck up?

405
00:27:16,895 --> 00:27:18,969
You have no idea what
I've been through here,

406
00:27:18,994 --> 00:27:21,330
no idea what I have seen!

407
00:27:22,926 --> 00:27:24,668
So why don't we just....

408
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:28,267
Where are you going?

409
00:27:28,371 --> 00:27:30,247
None of your fucking business!

410
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,450
Asshole.

411
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,223
Fucking guy.

412
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:39,122
Mind your fucking business, Dale.

413
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:52,945
Get the fuck off me!

414
00:28:54,082 --> 00:28:56,000
The hell's wrong with you?

415
00:29:01,098 --> 00:29:02,429
Fuck this!

416
00:29:09,219 --> 00:29:11,263
I'm pretty sure that one might be full.

417
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:15,794
Yeah. We gotta make sure we bring back

418
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:18,864
as much as possible this first trip.

419
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:21,104
Kenny?

420
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:25,054
Kenny, look at me.

421
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:26,135
What?

422
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:28,724
Look, I can't even begin to imagine

423
00:29:28,749 --> 00:29:30,309
what you're going through right now,

424
00:29:30,334 --> 00:29:32,102
and I'm not gonna pretend like

425
00:29:32,127 --> 00:29:33,771
I know the magic words
that are just somehow...

426
00:29:33,796 --> 00:29:35,393
Where's your bag?

427
00:29:35,628 --> 00:29:36,768
What?

428
00:29:37,065 --> 00:29:38,244
Your bag,

429
00:29:38,634 --> 00:29:40,893
the one you're supposed to be
putting crops in. Is it full?

430
00:29:42,288 --> 00:29:44,155
Is that why you came out here?
To play nursemaid?

431
00:29:44,181 --> 00:29:46,283
No, Kenny. I came out here
because I care about you.

432
00:29:46,308 --> 00:29:48,767
That's great. Why don't you care about
me while you do your fucking job?

433
00:29:48,793 --> 00:29:50,914
Because we have two hours left,
and if we don't bring back

434
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,690
- as much food as possible...
- You can't just leave.

435
00:29:52,716 --> 00:29:55,815
I can do whatever the fuck I
want, and right now, I wanna go.

436
00:29:56,674 --> 00:29:58,837
- What's going on?
- I'm going back to town!

437
00:29:58,948 --> 00:30:01,737
Jade, you're never gonna
make it back before dark.

438
00:30:01,779 --> 00:30:03,381
Well, I'm sure as fuck not staying here!

439
00:30:03,407 --> 00:30:05,588
Let's all just take a breath, okay?

440
00:30:06,745 --> 00:30:08,847
I played along with the
whole "Let's draw straws

441
00:30:08,872 --> 00:30:10,808
to see who gets the food" bullshit.

442
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,420
- I came out here to help!
- Okay.

443
00:30:12,446 --> 00:30:13,672
I don't like it here.

444
00:30:13,698 --> 00:30:16,112
Who the fuck likes it anywhere?
It's a forest full of nightmares.

445
00:30:16,138 --> 00:30:18,189
No. This is different.
This is diff... Look.

446
00:30:18,215 --> 00:30:20,818
I wanna help. I do, okay?
I wanna help, but I...

447
00:30:20,843 --> 00:30:22,695
I'll be more helpful back in town.

448
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:25,109
You're not gonna make
it back to town. Okay?

449
00:30:25,135 --> 00:30:28,450
You might not even make it back to the
talisman hut, so just breathe, okay?

450
00:30:28,475 --> 00:30:29,690
I'll make it if I run.

451
00:30:29,716 --> 00:30:32,401
Just stop. Okay. Stop. Stop.

452
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:33,786
We have shelter here.

453
00:30:33,897 --> 00:30:37,209
We have talismans here,
and we need this food.

454
00:30:37,234 --> 00:30:39,378
Jade, if we go back
to town empty-handed,

455
00:30:39,403 --> 00:30:41,018
people starve.

456
00:30:42,234 --> 00:30:43,377
Good luck.

457
00:30:43,995 --> 00:30:45,609
- Jade!
- He's right. If he hurries,

458
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,019
he'll probably make it back to
the talisman hut before sundown.

459
00:30:48,084 --> 00:30:49,651
- Jade! Jade!
- Kristi!

460
00:30:49,685 --> 00:30:52,713
Hold on! You're going
the wrong way! Jade!

461
00:30:54,171 --> 00:30:55,260
Kristi!

462
00:30:56,337 --> 00:30:57,646
Jade, just hold on!

463
00:30:57,671 --> 00:30:59,148
You don't even know where you're going!

464
00:30:59,173 --> 00:31:02,151
Will you just stop for two seconds
and think about what you're doing?

465
00:31:02,176 --> 00:31:04,995
Oh, trust me. I've done nothing
but think about what I'm doing!

466
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:07,500
I shouldn't be out here! I
should be back at the bar,

467
00:31:07,526 --> 00:31:09,252
trying to figure out how to...

468
00:31:09,627 --> 00:31:11,565
- Fuck!
- Kristi.

469
00:31:11,591 --> 00:31:12,667
Kristi!

470
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,604
- My foot...
- Fuck! Get... get off her!

471
00:31:15,713 --> 00:31:17,461
- What the fuck did you do?
- What the hell?

472
00:31:17,487 --> 00:31:19,799
It's not his fault! Just get
this fucking thing off of me!

473
00:31:21,601 --> 00:31:24,323
There should be a release somewhere.
I don't know.

474
00:31:25,587 --> 00:31:26,626
Yes.

475
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,620
- Get this fucking thing off.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

476
00:31:30,784 --> 00:31:32,556
You're okay. Breathe.

477
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:35,517
- What the fuck?
- Okay. I got it.

478
00:31:40,397 --> 00:31:41,541
Oh, fuck.

479
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:55,789
How's this?

480
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:57,341
Looks good to me.

481
00:31:57,481 --> 00:31:59,434
Why don't you take all these in the back

482
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,630
and get them cleaned?

483
00:32:00,656 --> 00:32:01,880
Okay.

484
00:32:04,368 --> 00:32:05,761
Hey, little man.

485
00:32:05,989 --> 00:32:07,349
Hi, Sheriff.

486
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:09,285
And what are you guys up to?

487
00:32:09,498 --> 00:32:11,887
We're just making sure
everything's clean and put away

488
00:32:11,913 --> 00:32:14,099
the way
Tian-Chen would like it.

489
00:32:15,217 --> 00:32:16,849
Oh, wow. That's really...

490
00:32:19,343 --> 00:32:21,220
I'm sure she appreciates that.

491
00:32:22,342 --> 00:32:23,701
I hope so.

492
00:32:28,597 --> 00:32:30,464
Came down here to get
one of the big pots

493
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,651
for soup for Colony House,

494
00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:35,472
and when I got here, I
found him cleaning.

495
00:32:36,335 --> 00:32:37,612
Poor kid.

496
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,401
He's had so much to deal with already.

497
00:32:42,284 --> 00:32:43,722
And what about you?

498
00:32:44,084 --> 00:32:45,269
How you doing?

499
00:32:46,901 --> 00:32:48,456
Aside from trying to process

500
00:32:48,482 --> 00:32:50,690
everything that's happened recently,

501
00:32:51,019 --> 00:32:52,928
including how a nursery rhyme

502
00:32:52,953 --> 00:32:55,612
my grandmother told me somehow...

503
00:32:57,862 --> 00:33:00,917
I don't know how I'm doing,
if I'm being honest.

504
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,651
Do you?

505
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:05,511
It's been a rough stretch.

506
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,089
Is it always like this?

507
00:33:08,817 --> 00:33:10,269
Does it get worse?

508
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,737
I mean, well, if I'm being honest,

509
00:33:12,952 --> 00:33:13,969
I don't know.

510
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:17,196
But... but I do know

511
00:33:17,222 --> 00:33:19,538
that no matter what this
place throws at us,

512
00:33:19,563 --> 00:33:21,964
we're gonna win, all right?

513
00:33:22,484 --> 00:33:24,336
No matter what happens here,

514
00:33:24,362 --> 00:33:26,620
we are going to find our way home.

515
00:33:27,234 --> 00:33:28,735
What if there isn't one?

516
00:33:29,735 --> 00:33:31,214
Well, of course there is.

517
00:33:31,882 --> 00:33:33,683
There's a way here, right?

518
00:33:34,077 --> 00:33:36,388
If there's a way here,
there's a way home.

519
00:33:36,413 --> 00:33:37,806
You don't know that.

520
00:33:37,831 --> 00:33:39,675
You just hope there is.

521
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:43,353
Tian-Chen thought she was going
home, and so did my mom.

522
00:33:43,378 --> 00:33:47,519
Hey, we are not giving
up on your mom, okay?

523
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:49,823
Maybe you should.

524
00:33:55,001 --> 00:33:56,167
Yeah.

525
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,159
I'm sorry.

526
00:34:05,937 --> 00:34:08,248
This thing must have been
here for decades at least.

527
00:34:08,445 --> 00:34:10,214
It's a good thing, too,
'cause all that rust and crap

528
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,539
probably saved your foot.

529
00:34:11,565 --> 00:34:13,433
- Lucky me.
- Let's see if I can wedge this in there.

530
00:34:13,459 --> 00:34:15,266
- Okay. Just back up. Back up.
- I'm just trying to help.

531
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:16,620
You've helped! Gimme that.

532
00:34:16,646 --> 00:34:18,222
You wanna go back to town, go!
Get the fuck outta here.

533
00:34:18,248 --> 00:34:20,265
Kenny, we gotta get
this thing off her leg

534
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,698
before the sun goes down!

535
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:24,808
- Really, Jade? Thanks! Get the fuck
outta here! - Enough!

536
00:34:25,183 --> 00:34:28,607
This is nobody's fault, so just cut
the shit and let's figure this out!

537
00:34:28,632 --> 00:34:30,192
Why don't we just break the chain?

538
00:34:30,217 --> 00:34:31,946
At least then we could get her inside.

539
00:34:31,972 --> 00:34:34,300
- Break it with what?
- I don't know, smart guy.

540
00:34:34,326 --> 00:34:36,339
You're supposed to be the genius.

541
00:34:38,563 --> 00:34:40,120
Sorry. I'm sorry.

542
00:34:42,853 --> 00:34:44,038
Sorry.

543
00:34:44,441 --> 00:34:45,588
Fuck!

544
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,374
We need something that's
gonna give us more leverage.

545
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,816
All right, we need...

546
00:34:52,127 --> 00:34:54,066
You, come with me.

547
00:34:54,241 --> 00:34:55,339
What?

548
00:34:55,729 --> 00:34:58,357
Just don't do anything
until we get back!

549
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,128
I know they're here somewhere.

550
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:10,425
Poor thing's exhausted.

551
00:35:10,465 --> 00:35:13,081
I'm glad he's finally getting some rest.

552
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,855
Here they are.

553
00:35:25,136 --> 00:35:26,738
Those what I think they are?

554
00:35:26,764 --> 00:35:28,958
They are if you think
they're tarot cards.

555
00:35:28,984 --> 00:35:30,412
You can't be serious.

556
00:35:31,264 --> 00:35:33,569
You wanna know if your baby's all right?

557
00:35:33,595 --> 00:35:35,741
These here are gonna tell us.

558
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:40,345
This was a bad idea.

559
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,113
Hey. Where are you going?

560
00:35:42,776 --> 00:35:44,207
Where am I going?

561
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:46,418
I opened up to you.

562
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,722
I confided in you. I...

563
00:35:50,456 --> 00:35:53,357
You know what? Your whole
kooky, batty Tillie shtick

564
00:35:53,383 --> 00:35:56,582
is fine in most circumstances,
but how dare you?

565
00:35:56,777 --> 00:35:59,207
Now, hold on a second.

566
00:35:59,968 --> 00:36:01,746
Is that what you think of me?

567
00:36:02,277 --> 00:36:03,933
Kooky, batty Tillie,

568
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:07,938
just goofing around about
something this important to you?

569
00:36:07,964 --> 00:36:09,941
Is that what you think of me?

570
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,589
I don't know.

571
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,105
I don't know anything about you.

572
00:36:14,468 --> 00:36:16,347
- Look. Just...
- Now

573
00:36:16,668 --> 00:36:18,884
so, you don't believe.

574
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:20,066
That's fine,

575
00:36:20,092 --> 00:36:22,720
but before you saw
that tree in the road,

576
00:36:22,746 --> 00:36:25,597
I'll bet you didn't believe
in half the stuff we see here

577
00:36:25,623 --> 00:36:28,082
every day and night, did you?

578
00:36:28,903 --> 00:36:33,090
These things played a
pretty big role in my life

579
00:36:33,256 --> 00:36:35,230
at a pretty critical juncture.

580
00:36:36,392 --> 00:36:38,310
I just want to share that with you.

581
00:36:43,811 --> 00:36:47,634
These cards were given to
me by a gal named Gertie.

582
00:36:48,642 --> 00:36:51,728
She was in the same hospice
care as my husband.

583
00:36:53,417 --> 00:36:57,145
She did a reading for
me after he passed.

584
00:36:57,171 --> 00:36:58,548
Shuffle, please.

585
00:36:58,876 --> 00:37:02,772
I thought that it was a
bit silly at the time,

586
00:37:02,798 --> 00:37:07,329
but now I realize that those cards...

587
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,859
told me about my cancer,

588
00:37:09,947 --> 00:37:11,924
told me about this place,

589
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:14,579
maybe not in so many words,

590
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:18,720
but the signs were all there
if I'd known how to read them.

591
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,462
Please.

592
00:37:21,845 --> 00:37:22,931
Thank you.

593
00:37:22,957 --> 00:37:26,048
Do you now know how to read them?

594
00:37:26,074 --> 00:37:29,626
Yeah, a lot better than I was before.

595
00:37:37,352 --> 00:37:38,908
Ask them a question.

596
00:37:40,031 --> 00:37:41,884
And let's see what they answer.

597
00:37:42,075 --> 00:37:43,486
The worst thing that could happen

598
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:45,970
is you feel a bit silly once we're done.

599
00:37:52,341 --> 00:37:54,127
Is my baby okay?

600
00:37:56,212 --> 00:37:57,916
Let's see what the cards have to say.

601
00:38:01,743 --> 00:38:03,040
What was that?

602
00:38:26,899 --> 00:38:28,625
This is a really bad idea.

603
00:38:28,955 --> 00:38:31,400
There's nothing else strong
enough to pry that trap open.

604
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:33,468
You really wanna start pulling apart

605
00:38:33,494 --> 00:38:36,174
the ancient tower of holy scary shit?

606
00:38:36,854 --> 00:38:38,994
I'm sure whoever built it won't mind.

607
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,517
Oh, Jesus. Fuck!

608
00:38:45,205 --> 00:38:46,345
Fuck.

609
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,366
Where the hell are they?

610
00:38:48,391 --> 00:38:50,260
- Kenny, listen to me.
- Yeah.

611
00:38:50,736 --> 00:38:53,997
- If this goes bad...
- Hey, stop, stop. You're gonna be fine, okay?

612
00:38:54,022 --> 00:38:56,197
- We still have plenty of daylight left.
- Ken... Kenny!

613
00:38:56,358 --> 00:38:58,210
Enough, okay?

614
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:00,330
We're gonna get you out of this
thing, and you're gonna be fine.

615
00:39:00,356 --> 00:39:02,275
Boyd told me what your mom said.

616
00:39:03,906 --> 00:39:06,425
No matter what happens here,
you'll never be alone.

617
00:39:06,857 --> 00:39:08,275
Do you understand me?

618
00:39:09,235 --> 00:39:11,236
You'll never be alone, okay?

619
00:39:11,993 --> 00:39:13,386
You're gonna be fine.

620
00:39:13,412 --> 00:39:14,588
I know.

621
00:39:14,946 --> 00:39:17,056
Just tell me you heard what I said.

622
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:20,148
- Just tell me you understand.
- Okay. Okay.

623
00:39:20,173 --> 00:39:22,478
I heard you. I understand that...

624
00:39:22,689 --> 00:39:25,195
- Where have you been? Let's go!
- Getting us some leverage!

625
00:39:25,221 --> 00:39:27,158
- Okay. Here we go. Get behind her.
- Yeah, yeah.

626
00:39:27,184 --> 00:39:28,252
Get on that side.

627
00:39:28,278 --> 00:39:31,075
As soon as this opens up,
you pull her out, okay?

628
00:39:31,101 --> 00:39:33,172
- Ready? Okay. Here we go.
- Okay.

629
00:39:33,198 --> 00:39:34,236
And pull!

630
00:39:34,377 --> 00:39:35,431
You okay?

631
00:39:35,686 --> 00:39:36,784
Open!

632
00:39:37,438 --> 00:39:38,789
Pull! Pull!

633
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:40,611
Shit.

634
00:39:41,055 --> 00:39:43,254
- What? Are you good?
- My ankle.

635
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,390
- It's dislocated. We have to reset it.
- What? What?

636
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,330
- Okay.
- Okay.

637
00:39:47,356 --> 00:39:48,749
Hold my foot, Kenny.

638
00:39:48,775 --> 00:39:50,251
Dale, I need you behind me.

639
00:39:50,385 --> 00:39:51,924
Jade, I need you to hold
on to my other foot.

640
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,400
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

641
00:39:53,988 --> 00:39:56,758
Kenny, keep your one hand above...
above my foot

642
00:39:56,784 --> 00:39:58,697
and the other under my ankle.

643
00:40:02,171 --> 00:40:03,908
Okay? All right.

644
00:40:18,268 --> 00:40:19,336
Jade!

645
00:40:21,401 --> 00:40:23,085
- Focus. Okay?
- Oh, yeah.

646
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,372
All right. Okay. You with me?

647
00:40:25,437 --> 00:40:27,093
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

648
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:30,931
One, two, three!

649
00:40:32,617 --> 00:40:33,780
You okay?

650
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:35,792
Are you okay?

651
00:40:35,818 --> 00:40:37,127
- You good?
- Fuck.

652
00:40:37,153 --> 00:40:38,265
Yeah?

653
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,976
- You okay?
- Christ.

654
00:40:40,086 --> 00:40:41,593
All right. Let's...

655
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:43,147
Let's get her back to camp.
It's gonna be dark soon.

656
00:40:43,173 --> 00:40:44,274
Yeah, yeah.

657
00:40:44,298 --> 00:40:46,632
Okay. Here we go. Ready?

658
00:40:46,843 --> 00:40:48,320
Let's go that way.

659
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,211
- Go, go, go.
- Fuck!

660
00:40:50,237 --> 00:40:51,726
Watch where you step.

661
00:41:28,755 --> 00:41:29,925
Hey.

662
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,316
It's just me.

663
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:36,426
Did you...

664
00:41:37,552 --> 00:41:38,738
What's going on?

665
00:41:40,868 --> 00:41:42,863
Nothing. I thought...

666
00:41:43,637 --> 00:41:45,644
- Hey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

667
00:41:46,153 --> 00:41:48,042
The other day with the animals...

668
00:41:50,706 --> 00:41:52,249
What the fuck do you want?

669
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:57,406
I was thinking...

670
00:41:58,666 --> 00:42:00,346
maybe we switch tonight.

671
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:01,863
Switch what?

672
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:03,261
Accommodations.

673
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,105
You take the sheriff's station.
I'll take the bus.

674
00:42:06,256 --> 00:42:07,449
Why?

675
00:42:07,841 --> 00:42:11,081
Because I wanna watch our friends when
they come out of the woods tonight,

676
00:42:11,107 --> 00:42:12,706
see what they're up to.

677
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,933
- You wanna watch?
- Yeah.

678
00:42:18,268 --> 00:42:19,550
How come?

679
00:42:20,253 --> 00:42:21,316
Well,

680
00:42:21,924 --> 00:42:24,828
I think it's time we change things
up a little bit around here.

681
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,466
You okay?

682
00:42:34,179 --> 00:42:36,944
Yeah. I'm just... I'm just a
little carsick. That's all.

683
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:39,655
How much further?

684
00:42:40,021 --> 00:42:41,998
It's just down the road.

685
00:42:42,024 --> 00:42:45,090
There should be some crackers
in the glove compartment there.

686
00:42:45,116 --> 00:42:46,858
Might settle your stomach.

687
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,149
Okay.

688
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:08,449
Where did you get this?

689
00:43:11,066 --> 00:43:13,629
Miranda made that for me, so...

690
00:43:16,842 --> 00:43:17,984
What's wrong?

691
00:43:19,657 --> 00:43:21,254
I'm so stupid.

692
00:43:23,324 --> 00:43:24,642
I'm so stupid. I'm so stupid.

693
00:43:24,667 --> 00:43:25,856
I'm so stupid.

694
00:43:25,882 --> 00:43:27,227
This can't be real.

695
00:43:27,253 --> 00:43:28,887
This can't be real.

696
00:43:32,574 --> 00:43:33,824
I...

697
00:43:35,178 --> 00:43:38,281
I went through a magic tree
and traveled to a lighthouse

698
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,228
like something out of a fairytale.

699
00:43:40,254 --> 00:43:44,137
I wake up in the hospital
that just happens to be here.

700
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,758
You just happen to be here.

701
00:43:46,846 --> 00:43:49,490
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

702
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:51,106
No, no.

703
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:54,379
No, but this was your mistake.

704
00:43:54,426 --> 00:43:57,160
- This was too far.
- I don't understand.

705
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,387
- What does that have to do with...
- I made this for my husband

706
00:44:00,413 --> 00:44:02,306
a long time ago, and he lost it.

707
00:44:02,377 --> 00:44:04,199
And then I found this...

708
00:44:05,484 --> 00:44:06,863
in the diner.

709
00:44:07,043 --> 00:44:08,535
Okay.

710
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:15,121
We're not really in
Camden, Maine, are we?

711
00:44:16,357 --> 00:44:17,497
What?

712
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,255
It's just more of this place,

713
00:44:21,387 --> 00:44:23,451
torturing me, punishing me, right?

714
00:44:23,707 --> 00:44:25,996
What are you talking about?

715
00:44:26,022 --> 00:44:27,622
You need to pull over right now.

716
00:44:27,647 --> 00:44:30,121
- What? Where...
- You need to pull over right now, please!

717
00:44:30,147 --> 00:44:31,983
All right, all right, I'm pulling over.

718
00:44:36,447 --> 00:44:38,215
I don't understand. Look.

719
00:44:38,241 --> 00:44:41,212
What happens if I get out of the car?

720
00:44:41,238 --> 00:44:44,347
- Get out of... - What happens
if I refuse to play along?

721
00:44:44,372 --> 00:44:46,224
Do I end up back at the hospital again?

722
00:44:46,249 --> 00:44:47,723
Does it start all over?

723
00:44:47,749 --> 00:44:50,059
I don't know what's happening right now,

724
00:44:50,148 --> 00:44:53,085
but the park, the tree,
it's just down the street!

725
00:44:53,173 --> 00:44:54,482
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Please!

726
00:44:54,507 --> 00:44:57,309
- No, no, no, no.
- You can't do this!

727
00:44:57,434 --> 00:44:59,517
You can't just show up at my door,

728
00:44:59,543 --> 00:45:03,431
say the things you've said,
tell me my son is alive!

729
00:45:03,457 --> 00:45:05,869
- No, no, no.
- My boy, that he's out there!

730
00:45:05,894 --> 00:45:07,245
- No!
- And then you just decide

731
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:09,431
- that you're gonna give up on that!
- I can't.

732
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:12,199
- No, no! No!
- No, no! God!

733
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:13,793
We're going!

734
00:45:24,753 --> 00:45:26,127
Where am I?

735
00:45:26,875 --> 00:45:28,265
- Don't sit up.
- Jim?

736
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:29,502
You're okay.

737
00:45:30,171 --> 00:45:32,798
You're okay. You were in a car accident.

738
00:45:32,988 --> 00:45:34,502
Oh, my God.

739
00:45:36,742 --> 00:45:39,712
So you're the lady with the lunchbox.

740
00:45:41,532 --> 00:45:42,665
What?

741
00:45:42,691 --> 00:45:45,119
It was in your report at the hospital.

742
00:45:45,214 --> 00:45:48,076
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

743
00:45:48,102 --> 00:45:50,884
He's having a little trouble,
but we're monitoring him.

744
00:45:51,197 --> 00:45:53,782
- Okay. - The hospital staff
was worried about you.

745
00:45:53,808 --> 00:45:55,663
We've had patrol cars
on the lookout for you

746
00:45:55,689 --> 00:45:57,931
ever since you ran out the other
day, but you're gonna be all right.

747
00:45:57,957 --> 00:46:00,337
No, no, no. I don't wanna
go to the hospital.

748
00:46:00,363 --> 00:46:02,228
- You need to lie still.
- Ma'am.

749
00:46:02,642 --> 00:46:04,108
Please, I'm fine.

750
00:46:04,134 --> 00:46:06,596
- Ma'am, please.
- Just stop and let me out.

751
00:46:07,532 --> 00:46:09,069
Hey, everything all right?

752
00:46:09,165 --> 00:46:11,423
There's a tree in the
middle of the road.

753
00:46:16,045 --> 00:46:18,412
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

754
00:46:19,015 --> 00:46:20,473
No, no, no.

755
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:22,099
Oh, my God.
