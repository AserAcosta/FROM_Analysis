00:00:16,994 --> 00:00:18,345
Previously on From...

2
00:00:18,371 --> 00:00:20,788
Ever since you fell asleep
and your eyes got all white,

3
00:00:20,814 --> 00:00:22,058
you've been different.

4
00:00:22,084 --> 00:00:25,557
All I remember is being more scared
than I've ever been in my entire life.

5
00:00:26,154 --> 00:00:28,549
You really need to get some rest.

6
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:31,302
Boyd said it was okay to sleep again.

7
00:00:31,328 --> 00:00:32,744
It's not that. It's...

8
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,501
I feel like something is watching me.

9
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:39,507
Help me.

10
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:42,187
You're... you're Victor's father.

11
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,644
Miranda used to call it the bottle tree.

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,101
The original is in a park

13
00:00:47,226 --> 00:00:48,734
a few towns over.

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,302
You need to take me there right now.

15
00:00:54,442 --> 00:00:55,796
Where am I?

16
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,164
There's a tree in the
middle of the road.

17
00:00:58,492 --> 00:00:59,999
Just take a detour!

18
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:02,249
- Go around it!
- You have to listen to me.

19
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:04,226
It's not safe to stop out
here once it gets dark.

20
00:01:04,252 --> 00:01:06,335
There are things in this
town that will hurt us.

21
00:01:08,217 --> 00:01:10,694
- Jim!
- Tabitha.

22
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,218
Please help us!

23
00:01:12,244 --> 00:01:14,515
There's a toolkit on the bus. I got it.

24
00:01:16,882 --> 00:01:18,687
I can't find the fucking keys!

25
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:20,070
Are you looking for these?

26
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:23,077
We get to keep Randall, though.

27
00:01:25,161 --> 00:01:26,679
What the fuck?

28
00:01:28,529 --> 00:01:30,840
- What was that?
- Nicky's been shot!

29
00:01:30,896 --> 00:01:34,296
She's bleeding internally.
Nicky, stay with me.

30
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,803
You look much better.

31
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,453
You've been eating a little more?

32
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:43,653
Yeah.

33
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:45,739
Finally found something
I could keep down.

34
00:01:47,695 --> 00:01:48,958
Donna?

35
00:01:50,673 --> 00:01:53,020
Why is this happening?

36
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,638
Why can't they stop?

37
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:08,927
Everyone out of the way.

38
00:02:08,953 --> 00:02:10,169
Out of the way!

39
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:12,775
- Clear a path!
- We're gonna need some fresh towels!

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,235
Okay. This needs moving.

41
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,146
Okay, okay. Out of the way.
Out of the way.

42
00:02:16,172 --> 00:02:17,756
All right. Get him down.

43
00:02:20,472 --> 00:02:21,669
Hurry!

44
00:02:21,695 --> 00:02:24,404
- Please. Please!
- What happened?

45
00:02:27,636 --> 00:02:28,996
Jesus.

46
00:02:29,223 --> 00:02:31,076
Tell us what you need.

47
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,396
Easy.

48
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:35,560
Here.

49
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:42,505
I need something to clean
and stitch his face,

50
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:45,685
- and I need more towels!
- Why would they do this?

51
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:47,091
Boyd?

52
00:02:48,162 --> 00:02:49,505
All right. Okay.

53
00:02:49,555 --> 00:02:52,833
- Stop! Okay.
- No, no, no. It's all right.

54
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:55,240
Stop. Take it easy. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

55
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:56,333
No, no, no.

56
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:58,331
You're gonna hurt yourself. You're
gonna hurt yourself. Take it easy.

57
00:02:58,357 --> 00:03:01,162
You did this. You fucking
left me out there, man.

58
00:03:01,188 --> 00:03:02,951
You fucking left me out there!

59
00:03:04,611 --> 00:03:07,919
You did this. You fucking left me!

60
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,123
www.subtitulamos.tv

61
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,427
What happened?

62
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,544
Where the hell did that come from?

63
00:05:23,683 --> 00:05:26,021
- Okay. Easy.
- It was a long night. Come on.

64
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:27,825
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah.

65
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:28,991
Kristi!

66
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,755
- Oh, my God!
- I'm okay.

67
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:33,163
- Jesus.
- Okay. It could have been a lot worse.

68
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:35,624
- Here. Let's get you inside.
- Yep. Careful.

69
00:05:38,094 --> 00:05:39,585
- I got her.
- Okay.

70
00:05:45,818 --> 00:05:47,211
Where's the food?

71
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:49,268
Dale and the others are
bringing it to storage.

72
00:05:49,294 --> 00:05:50,866
What the hell happened last night?

73
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,265
Boyd.

74
00:05:54,114 --> 00:05:55,561
Tabitha's back.

75
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:56,726
What?

76
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:59,671
She was on the ambulance
when it came into town.

77
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:01,382
How?

78
00:06:02,147 --> 00:06:05,257
Those weird trees in the
forest, she went through one.

79
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:07,260
She said it took her to a lighthouse.

80
00:06:07,497 --> 00:06:10,608
There's a meeting in the
diner this afternoon.

81
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:13,038
- Hey!
- It's okay.

82
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:15,194
Just let him go.

83
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,726
Let's go. All right.

84
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:19,085
Okay.

85
00:06:21,803 --> 00:06:24,030
I don't think that's quite your style.

86
00:06:24,157 --> 00:06:27,054
I was told I could look through these.

87
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:30,421
Of course. What's ours is yours.

88
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,123
Thanks.

89
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:36,507
I... I've sent some people
out to look for Victor.

90
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,123
It's not a big town.

91
00:06:40,915 --> 00:06:44,663
If I'd known was gonna see him...

92
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,576
I would have worn a better shirt.

93
00:06:49,196 --> 00:06:50,499
You know what?

94
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,359
There is a closet upstairs
where we keep the good stuff.

95
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,357
How 'bout we get you fixed up?

96
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,235
I'd appreciate that.

97
00:06:58,261 --> 00:06:59,894
Okay. Let's do that.

98
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:01,225
Come on.

99
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:03,960
Up here.

100
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:08,108
I thought you said Jasper
was in the tunnels.

101
00:07:08,134 --> 00:07:10,843
He is. We need supplies.

102
00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:14,921
We can't go into the tunnels
unless we have supplies.

103
00:07:14,947 --> 00:07:16,257
What supplies?

104
00:07:16,283 --> 00:07:19,304
We need to make sure we don't get lost.

105
00:07:25,964 --> 00:07:27,194
What happened?

106
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:29,327
Last night was...

107
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:31,584
It was a bad night.

108
00:07:40,622 --> 00:07:41,940
I'll wait outside.

109
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:48,198
Victor.

110
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:49,698
Who died?

111
00:07:52,463 --> 00:07:53,566
Nicky.

112
00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:58,354
And Randall got pretty torn up.

113
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,495
He's at the clinic now.

114
00:08:01,377 --> 00:08:03,083
I need some things from my room.

115
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,651
Look, Victor.

116
00:08:05,764 --> 00:08:08,221
Here. Come. Come. With me.

117
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,103
Come on.

118
00:08:14,716 --> 00:08:16,909
Something else happened last night.

119
00:08:16,935 --> 00:08:18,010
What?

120
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:23,291
- Tabitha came back.
- Really?

121
00:08:24,252 --> 00:08:26,885
And she had someone with her.

122
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,346
Victor, your dad is here.

123
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:37,346
- That's not possible. He...
- He's upstairs.

124
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,338
- No.
- Look, look.

125
00:08:39,364 --> 00:08:41,745
- I know this is a lot to take in.
- No.

126
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:43,541
- No. No.
- Victor.

127
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:45,034
No.

128
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,854
- Victor?
- No!

129
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:48,995
That was quick. Did you...

130
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:52,190
Victor! Where are you going?

131
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:57,916
Victor, will you please
just tell me what happened?

132
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,127
I thought you said we
were going to get Jasper.

133
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:03,615
Hey, stop!

134
00:09:03,963 --> 00:09:05,665
You're not being fair.

135
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,112
You came into my house,

136
00:09:07,138 --> 00:09:08,799
you made me sit in that fort, and now...

137
00:09:08,825 --> 00:09:10,877
Donna said my dad is here.

138
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:14,659
What? How?

139
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:16,635
It doesn't matter. You should go home.

140
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:19,799
We'll get Jasper later.

141
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:25,455
So, what was it like?

142
00:09:28,963 --> 00:09:30,180
It was...

143
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,599
You know, it was scary,

144
00:09:32,007 --> 00:09:35,061
waking up in the hospital,
not knowing if it was...

145
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,514
real or if I was still dreaming.

146
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:41,108
So, you really talked to Grandma?

147
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,186
I did.

148
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:47,148
I just don't understand.

149
00:09:47,174 --> 00:09:49,507
How do you go from a
lighthouse in the woods

150
00:09:49,582 --> 00:09:51,350
to a hospital in Maine?

151
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:54,132
Honey, I don't know.

152
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,975
I wish I could explain.

153
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,194
The important thing is that she's back,

154
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:02,311
and we're all together.

155
00:10:03,532 --> 00:10:04,600
Hey!

156
00:10:05,808 --> 00:10:07,366
I need to talk to you.

157
00:10:08,147 --> 00:10:09,975
- Back off, man.
- No, no, no. No.

158
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:11,921
Jim, it's okay. It's okay.

159
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:13,443
Please.

160
00:10:16,184 --> 00:10:17,483
Boyd said...

161
00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:21,007
Boyd said you went through a tree?

162
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:22,952
They're called Farway trees.

163
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:25,116
There's a bunch of them in the forest,

164
00:10:25,142 --> 00:10:26,637
but this one has bottles on it.

165
00:10:26,663 --> 00:10:27,960
The lighthouse.

166
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:31,160
Was it the same lighthouse
Miranda was looking for?

167
00:10:31,186 --> 00:10:32,788
I mean, it has to be.

168
00:10:32,814 --> 00:10:35,359
Can you get back there without the tree?

169
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,996
I don't know. I don't know.

170
00:10:37,022 --> 00:10:38,749
Okay. Then we need to go to the tree.

171
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:40,335
All right. So, hold on.

172
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:42,858
She just got back, and
you want to do what?

173
00:10:42,884 --> 00:10:44,991
I'm not saying go through it
again, but I need to see it.

174
00:10:45,147 --> 00:10:47,004
I've been there, okay?

175
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,163
It was the first place I looked
when she didn't come back.

176
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:51,304
There is nothing to see.

177
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,647
You mean besides the magic tree.

178
00:10:56,796 --> 00:10:58,832
Okay. The bottles. What
about the bottles?

179
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,530
- Was there anything special about them?
- I took a few of 'em down.

180
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:04,991
There were slips of paper inside
with numbers written on them.

181
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,100
Oh, my God. And you don't
think that's important?

182
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,022
I think this place does
a pretty great job

183
00:11:10,048 --> 00:11:11,952
on messing with our heads.

184
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,327
Wait. No. This is different.

185
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:16,397
It has to be.

186
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:21,429
Look. I get that this place
is one giant mindfuck, but...

187
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:24,389
Pardon my French.

188
00:11:24,794 --> 00:11:27,233
But she went home, okay?

189
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:29,554
That's not a trick. It's not a dream!

190
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,058
That's real, and there is a
whole town full of people

191
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,077
who are gonna be banging down
your door demanding answers

192
00:11:34,103 --> 00:11:36,734
whether you have them or not.
Take me to the tree.

193
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:38,905
Let's see if we can find some.

194
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,554
I told Boyd that I was gonna
go to that town meeting.

195
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,093
Oh, fuck the town meeting! Sorry. Sorry.

196
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:45,864
Okay. Look.

197
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:48,271
Town meeting isn't gonna solve anything,

198
00:11:48,297 --> 00:11:49,921
but going to the tree,

199
00:11:51,074 --> 00:11:52,686
at least it's a start.

200
00:11:56,927 --> 00:11:59,592
We had to leave some of the
food back at the settlement.

201
00:11:59,788 --> 00:12:00,968
We...

202
00:12:01,593 --> 00:12:03,540
we'll probably need to send another team

203
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:05,789
out before the next snowfall.

204
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,655
Yeah. We'll figure it out.

205
00:12:10,561 --> 00:12:12,413
Boyd, there is something out there,

206
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:14,244
something different.

207
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,596
We heard it both times now,

208
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,010
walking around outside
the cabins at night.

209
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:22,916
Okay.

210
00:12:25,182 --> 00:12:27,783
If walking around is all it's doing,

211
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:31,525
then, we got bigger
things to worry about.

212
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:44,958
What they did to Randall...

213
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:48,486
Why'd they leave him alive?
Why not just kill him?

214
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,736
I think they want us to look at him.

215
00:12:57,384 --> 00:12:58,838
When the sun's up,

216
00:12:59,535 --> 00:13:02,064
they want us to remember
what's coming at night.

217
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,685
Part of the thing that
keeps people sane here

218
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:08,424
is we get to pretend during the daytime,

219
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:12,166
pretend that we're safe.

220
00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:16,658
With Randall walking around,

221
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,174
then we don't get to pretend anymore.

222
00:13:25,128 --> 00:13:27,739
I removed the bullet, stabilized her.

223
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,716
One minute, she was fine, and
then all of a sudden, she wasn't.

224
00:13:31,371 --> 00:13:32,457
Jesus.

225
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,230
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

226
00:13:38,347 --> 00:13:39,527
Okay.

227
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:42,074
God. It's a miracle
there are no fractures.

228
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,853
- Mari.
- Probably have ligament damage.

229
00:13:45,716 --> 00:13:48,178
This should be elevated. I'm
gonna get you another pillow.

230
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,888
Mari, just stop for a second, please.

231
00:13:51,771 --> 00:13:53,790
Look, last night wasn't easy,

232
00:13:53,948 --> 00:13:55,601
and it wasn't your fault, okay?

233
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:56,911
Yeah, well...

234
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,099
- tell that to Nicky.
- I'm telling you.

235
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:03,302
Look. I know what it's like. I just...

236
00:14:03,997 --> 00:14:05,904
I don't... I don't want you to...

237
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:06,972
What?

238
00:14:09,427 --> 00:14:11,549
If you think I'm gonna start spiraling

239
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:14,044
- and stealing morphine again...
- I didn't say that.

240
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,645
You didn't have to.

241
00:14:19,104 --> 00:14:20,403
Hey. Come here.

242
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:22,450
Come here.

243
00:14:27,893 --> 00:14:31,068
Hey, you are the patient right now.

244
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:34,139
Can you please just
stop worrying about me

245
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,834
and let me worry about you?

246
00:14:39,775 --> 00:14:41,542
Can we worry about each other?

247
00:14:47,093 --> 00:14:48,321
I gotta go.

248
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:51,266
- Wait.
- Just get some rest, yeah?

249
00:15:03,165 --> 00:15:05,251
- No. Boyd...
- I just wanna help.

250
00:15:05,277 --> 00:15:06,471
I understand that.

251
00:15:06,497 --> 00:15:09,361
Boyd, you being here is just
gonna make things worse.

252
00:15:12,185 --> 00:15:13,245
I'm sorry.

253
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:14,392
No.

254
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:15,835
You're right.

255
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:18,072
Look, people need you out there.

256
00:15:18,146 --> 00:15:20,189
They're gonna need you
at the meeting later.

257
00:15:20,627 --> 00:15:21,827
Both of you.

258
00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:24,041
There's only so much people can take,

259
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,134
and now, with Tabitha being back,
the fact that she went home...

260
00:15:28,391 --> 00:15:30,142
- I gotta...
- Yeah.

261
00:15:33,428 --> 00:15:35,853
Hey, Randall. It's okay.

262
00:15:36,222 --> 00:15:37,726
Squeeze my hand.

263
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:39,445
- I'm going to take a look.
- All right.

264
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,588
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

265
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:42,220
You're okay.

266
00:15:47,778 --> 00:15:49,523
This is where he stays...

267
00:15:50,956 --> 00:15:52,367
most of the time.

268
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:10,003
It's...

269
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:14,105
It's a little different
from his room at home.

270
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,301
For the first few years,

271
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:32,574
every time I'd turn a corner,

272
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:36,582
there'd be this little spark of hope

273
00:16:36,608 --> 00:16:39,395
that maybe, just maybe,

274
00:16:39,686 --> 00:16:42,402
I'd see all of them there...

275
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:47,442
Miranda, Eloise, Victor.

276
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:52,410
And they'd smile and laugh.

277
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:58,395
We'd all cry together about what
a terrible mistake it all was.

278
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:00,730
Then...

279
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:06,323
That was the hardest part...

280
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:09,676
that little bit of hope.

281
00:17:13,387 --> 00:17:16,106
That was the part I couldn't bear.

282
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,197
As the years went by,

283
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:28,650
it became easier to tell myself

284
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:30,892
they were dead.

285
00:17:31,595 --> 00:17:32,939
They were gone.

286
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:36,494
So, that's what I did.

287
00:17:51,787 --> 00:17:54,591
All that time, my little boy was here,

288
00:17:55,888 --> 00:17:57,021
alone.

289
00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:03,917
What kind of man gives up on his family?

290
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,830
No wonder he doesn't wanna talk to me.

291
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,133
Just give him a little time.

292
00:18:18,455 --> 00:18:19,766
He'll come 'round.

293
00:18:21,242 --> 00:18:23,086
Sorry to interrupt,

294
00:18:23,774 --> 00:18:25,817
but we're all heading to the meeting.

295
00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:27,236
I'll be right there.

296
00:18:28,221 --> 00:18:29,461
Meeting?

297
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:34,078
People have a lot of questions
about what happened,

298
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,148
about Tabitha.

299
00:18:36,174 --> 00:18:37,352
Sure.

300
00:18:37,378 --> 00:18:40,297
It was kind of a big deal
that she got out of here.

301
00:18:42,975 --> 00:18:44,555
Come on.

302
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,656
Come on!

303
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,930
Okay, everybody, just take a seat.

304
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:51,211
- Hey, come on in.
- Sit down here.

305
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,524
Everybody grab a seat.

306
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,867
All right, everybody. Okay. All right.

307
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:02,372
All right. Look.

308
00:19:02,664 --> 00:19:06,037
I understand that everybody
wants answers, right?

309
00:19:06,531 --> 00:19:07,966
So do I, all right?

310
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:09,396
But the truth is,

311
00:19:09,422 --> 00:19:12,672
there's no easy explanations
to any of this, okay?

312
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:14,508
- There's nothing that...
- Where the hell is Tabitha?

313
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:16,039
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

314
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:19,226
She's coming, all right?

315
00:19:19,294 --> 00:19:21,289
Just try to remember,
she's been through a lot.

316
00:19:21,315 --> 00:19:24,203
All due respect, Boyd, but
we've all been through a lot.

317
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,469
That's right.

318
00:19:25,495 --> 00:19:27,789
- I understand that.
- Are you sure?

319
00:19:27,821 --> 00:19:31,063
'Cause I feel like if you had
any clue about anything,

320
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:32,961
she'd be the one talking instead of you.

321
00:19:32,987 --> 00:19:33,781
Yeah.

322
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:35,691
Look. Everybody calm the fuck down.

323
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,945
Hey, why were you in the ambulance?

324
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,922
Well, we were in an accident.

325
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:44,917
I was taking Tabitha
to a park near my...

326
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:46,344
Tabitha's here.

327
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,719
What do I say?

328
00:19:52,243 --> 00:19:53,742
Just tell 'em the truth.

329
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,066
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah. - Yeah.

330
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,347
Did you really go through a tree?

331
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,519
- Hey, let's let her talk.
- It's okay.

332
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,925
I did. Yes.

333
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:20,665
I imagine some of you
already know this,

334
00:20:20,691 --> 00:20:23,727
but, there are some trees in the forest

335
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:25,751
that aren't like the other trees.

336
00:20:29,368 --> 00:20:32,206
Hey. Town meeting's already started.

337
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,173
Yeah. I just gotta grab something.

338
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:03,409
Hello?

339
00:21:22,022 --> 00:21:23,633
Why did you bring me here?

340
00:21:24,507 --> 00:21:26,469
'Cause I wanted you to see

341
00:21:27,624 --> 00:21:29,741
that if you climb high enough,

342
00:21:30,482 --> 00:21:32,718
even a nightmare can look like a dream.

343
00:22:02,594 --> 00:22:03,679
Hello?

344
00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:07,902
Hey, Elgin.

345
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:09,379
Oh, my...

346
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,523
- What the fuck?
- I'm so sorry.

347
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:13,636
- I thought you...
- Oh, my God.

348
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,354
- I'm sorry.
- Are you okay?

349
00:22:17,228 --> 00:22:18,332
No.

350
00:22:19,522 --> 00:22:20,902
Not really.

351
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:25,308
- I'm sorry.
- No. Wait.

352
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,732
I could use some company,

353
00:22:28,758 --> 00:22:31,863
if you're not, you know, busy.

354
00:22:32,189 --> 00:22:33,261
Sure.

355
00:22:34,257 --> 00:22:35,335
Victor?

356
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,769
What are you doing? It's cold out here.

357
00:22:39,671 --> 00:22:41,707
I never drew pictures of him.

358
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:43,879
What?

359
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,707
When I was alone here, I never...

360
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,793
I always drew pictures
of things that I saw,

361
00:22:51,652 --> 00:22:54,941
because I knew the pictures
would remember, but I never...

362
00:22:55,149 --> 00:22:56,582
I never drew...

363
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,168
pictures of what came before.

364
00:23:02,095 --> 00:23:06,408
And now I told myself that
was a dream and that...

365
00:23:06,463 --> 00:23:07,542
that...

366
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,324
he was...

367
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,942
Victor...

368
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,613
None of that matters.

369
00:23:17,756 --> 00:23:19,107
He's here.

370
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:21,520
Somehow, your father is here,

371
00:23:21,546 --> 00:23:23,168
and he's waiting for you back in town.

372
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,379
No. No. He's waiting for a little boy

373
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:27,722
that drove away a long time ago.

374
00:23:31,697 --> 00:23:33,332
What's he gonna think...

375
00:23:36,063 --> 00:23:39,246
when he sees... me?

376
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,301
I don't know.

377
00:23:48,406 --> 00:23:50,566
I know I'm supposed to tell you that

378
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:52,894
it'll be okay,

379
00:23:53,262 --> 00:23:55,176
and he'll love you no matter what.

380
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,355
But I don't know if that's true.

381
00:24:00,804 --> 00:24:03,058
You're really bad at this.

382
00:24:03,815 --> 00:24:05,152
Sorry.

383
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,261
I don't know you that well,

384
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,465
but you seem like a really good person,

385
00:24:16,835 --> 00:24:19,505
and that's something
to be proud of here.

386
00:24:20,517 --> 00:24:22,410
I would give anything

387
00:24:22,888 --> 00:24:24,933
to feel like a good person again.

388
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:28,761
Maybe...

389
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:34,246
Maybe you're not the
only one who's afraid.

390
00:24:36,146 --> 00:24:39,246
Maybe he's afraid of not being the dad

391
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,668
that little boy remembers.

392
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,039
So, you see this woman in the
kimono even when you're awake?

393
00:25:10,249 --> 00:25:12,289
Now, I do. Yeah.

394
00:25:13,544 --> 00:25:15,250
Is she trying to hurt you?

395
00:25:16,508 --> 00:25:18,617
I thought she was at first,

396
00:25:18,805 --> 00:25:20,282
but when I saw her last night,

397
00:25:20,308 --> 00:25:21,719
she asked me for my help.

398
00:25:23,613 --> 00:25:24,883
With what?

399
00:25:25,714 --> 00:25:26,828
I don't know.

400
00:25:27,641 --> 00:25:30,727
If my grandma was here, she'd probably
tell me it was an angel or somethin'.

401
00:25:31,547 --> 00:25:34,800
"Remember now, there's a reason
why angels say 'Fear not'

402
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,641
when they saw someone.

403
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,836
Even Gabriel was terrifying."

404
00:25:41,404 --> 00:25:43,438
Look at you, Mr. Bible Study.

405
00:25:49,027 --> 00:25:50,654
You wanna know the fucked up part?

406
00:25:53,492 --> 00:25:55,789
I would take the creepy
kimono woman in a heartbeat

407
00:25:55,815 --> 00:25:58,000
over the shit I hear in my head now.

408
00:26:00,147 --> 00:26:01,375
Like what?

409
00:26:02,406 --> 00:26:04,157
Mostly just screaming.

410
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,578
But I don't...

411
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:10,047
I don't just hear it. It's like...

412
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,445
It's like I can feel it, too.

413
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:16,172
This is the only thing
that makes it quiet.

414
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,969
You talk to your folks about it?

415
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:26,836
What are they gonna do?

416
00:26:30,354 --> 00:26:32,219
They're in the diner right
now with everyone else,

417
00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:34,688
trying to figure out what it
means that my mom got out.

418
00:26:35,953 --> 00:26:37,774
What do you think it means?

419
00:26:38,895 --> 00:26:40,899
Honestly, I don't think
it means anything.

420
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,414
I think this whole place exists...

421
00:26:49,418 --> 00:26:51,711
I think it's just here
to make us suffer.

422
00:26:52,048 --> 00:26:53,867
Maybe that's why it let her out.

423
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:56,180
What do you mean?

424
00:26:56,853 --> 00:26:59,094
Best way to make us suffer
is to give us hope.

425
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,313
I don't think it's ever gonna let us go.

426
00:27:11,344 --> 00:27:13,784
You're so depressing when you're stoned.

427
00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:17,378
Sorry.

428
00:27:20,277 --> 00:27:22,191
And then the next thing I knew,

429
00:27:22,534 --> 00:27:24,444
the ambulance had stopped.

430
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,019
The driver said that there was a
tree in the middle of the road,

431
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,863
and you all know how
things go from there.

432
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:30,931
Come on in.

433
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,456
When you were out there
did you contact anyone?

434
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:38,980
Did you let the police,
anyone know about this place?

435
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,620
I really wanted to.

436
00:27:41,722 --> 00:27:43,339
Are you fucking kidding me?

437
00:27:43,365 --> 00:27:45,769
- Watch your mouth.
- Come on.

438
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:47,271
That could be it.

439
00:27:48,253 --> 00:27:51,159
You don't understand. They
wouldn't have believed me.

440
00:27:51,185 --> 00:27:52,870
Tabitha, you don't know that.

441
00:27:52,896 --> 00:27:56,430
Look. All due respect, when she told me,

442
00:27:56,456 --> 00:27:58,316
I thought she was out of her mind.

443
00:27:58,342 --> 00:27:59,797
But you believed her.

444
00:28:00,183 --> 00:28:02,155
Eventually, you believed her.

445
00:28:02,534 --> 00:28:05,370
To be fair, my circumstances

446
00:28:05,396 --> 00:28:08,407
are a little different
than the average person.

447
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:10,081
Look. I was in the ambulance

448
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,233
when she was begging us to turn around,

449
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:13,670
and we thought she was hysterical.

450
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,086
What is she even doing here?

451
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:17,141
- She killed someone last night.
- Yeah.

452
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:19,634
- All right. Oh, hey, hey!
- Come on!

453
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,235
- Look. That was an accident.
- Accident?

454
00:28:21,261 --> 00:28:24,844
Yeah, sure. Everything's an accident
unless it's somebody that you

455
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,110
and Queen Bee here don't like.

456
00:28:27,136 --> 00:28:29,983
I'm sorry to say this, but
you had an opportunity

457
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:32,126
that none of us have ever had before,

458
00:28:32,152 --> 00:28:33,438
and you blew it.

459
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,423
- Excuse me.
- We're just waiting here.

460
00:28:35,449 --> 00:28:37,712
What exactly would you have done?

461
00:28:38,454 --> 00:28:40,194
What would any of you have done?

462
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,688
I wouldn't have taken a
day trip to the park.

463
00:28:42,714 --> 00:28:45,430
- Yeah. Something.
- That's not what it was.

464
00:28:45,456 --> 00:28:47,548
- I wasn't taking a day trip.
- You were out there

465
00:28:47,574 --> 00:28:50,385
in the real world where people can help.

466
00:28:50,411 --> 00:28:52,597
How could you not take
advantage of that?

467
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,873
Yeah, they may have
thought you were crazy,

468
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,311
but what if they didn't?

469
00:28:56,337 --> 00:28:57,868
What if somebody believed you?

470
00:28:57,894 --> 00:29:00,415
Someone believed me,
and look where he is!

471
00:29:00,727 --> 00:29:02,508
He's sitting right here with us!

472
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:05,134
- Tabitha.
- Look. I'm sure everyone

473
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,040
could have done a better
job than what I did,

474
00:29:07,066 --> 00:29:09,751
and I'm so sorry you didn't
have that opportunity.

475
00:29:11,703 --> 00:29:14,024
I'm sorry I don't have your answers.

476
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:18,174
I'm sorry. I can't do this.
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

477
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,173
- Please.
- Tabitha.

478
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:21,735
Not now. That's enough.

479
00:29:22,593 --> 00:29:24,001
Oh, my God.

480
00:29:24,383 --> 00:29:25,579
Listen.

481
00:29:25,907 --> 00:29:27,969
Listen. The most important
part of all of this,

482
00:29:27,995 --> 00:29:30,528
the thing that we cannot lose sight of

483
00:29:30,985 --> 00:29:32,454
is Tabitha got out.

484
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:35,040
For all the good it seems to have done.

485
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,251
No, no, but it's not about the
fact that she is back here.

486
00:29:38,292 --> 00:29:40,790
It's that someone got home.

487
00:29:40,816 --> 00:29:43,048
It's not just hoping
and wishing anymore.

488
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:46,540
We have concrete proof now.
It's possible.

489
00:29:46,566 --> 00:29:48,360
Great. Where's the tree?

490
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:49,579
What?

491
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,360
Where... is... the... tree?

492
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,079
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

493
00:29:54,105 --> 00:29:57,866
Everybody just calm down.
Slow down for a second.

494
00:29:57,892 --> 00:30:00,939
- We gotta think about this, okay?
- What is there to think about?

495
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,781
Tabitha went through the
tree and got home, right?

496
00:30:03,815 --> 00:30:06,042
Why aren't we all lining
up to do the same?

497
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,762
Because it's not that simple, okay?

498
00:30:07,788 --> 00:30:09,562
We can't just run out
there into the forest

499
00:30:09,588 --> 00:30:11,868
and hop into the first tree that we see!

500
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:13,204
Why not?

501
00:30:13,788 --> 00:30:15,058
Excuse me?

502
00:30:15,092 --> 00:30:17,372
I just... I'm sorry, Boyd.

503
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:20,149
I don't wanna be here a second
longer than I have to be.

504
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:22,679
Even if there is the slightest chance

505
00:30:22,705 --> 00:30:26,257
that this tree can get us home,
what are we waiting for?

506
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:27,968
- Okay. Everybody just...
- No, no, no.

507
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,803
Dad, Dad, she's right, okay?

508
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:33,039
- We can't just sit here and talk all day...
- Okay! Stop, stop, stop, stop!

509
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:35,096
No! Listen! Hey, hey, hey!

510
00:30:35,883 --> 00:30:40,314
You're all assuming that this tree is
some kind of magic door. It's not.

511
00:30:40,503 --> 00:30:43,406
I went through one of those trees,
and you know where I ended up?

512
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:46,476
In a chimney underground.

513
00:30:46,913 --> 00:30:48,280
Damn near killed myself.

514
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,671
- Look.
- You don't...

515
00:30:49,697 --> 00:30:52,341
It wasn't even the tree
that got her out of here.

516
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:54,843
She said it was the lighthouse.

517
00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:57,309
Great. Let's just get to the lighthouse,

518
00:30:57,335 --> 00:30:59,130
- and then we'll go home.
- Listen to me, okay?

519
00:30:59,156 --> 00:31:00,501
No, you fucking listen!

520
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,671
- Dale, come on!
- No, no, no! I've had it!

521
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:05,820
I've had it! Had it with your... plans.

522
00:31:05,846 --> 00:31:08,057
I've had it with your fucking rules!

523
00:31:11,115 --> 00:31:12,734
I wanna go home!

524
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:27,583
Why didn't you go to the meeting?

525
00:31:29,997 --> 00:31:31,700
One thing you'll learn
when you're older,

526
00:31:31,726 --> 00:31:34,701
any meeting with more than three
people is basically pointless.

527
00:31:36,346 --> 00:31:38,685
- Jade?
- That was quick.

528
00:31:41,454 --> 00:31:42,830
How'd it go?

529
00:31:45,615 --> 00:31:46,740
Not great.

530
00:31:46,766 --> 00:31:47,833
See?

531
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:49,383
We're going to the tree.

532
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,458
- Finally.
- Wait. What?

533
00:31:51,484 --> 00:31:54,201
I have nothing to tell them, Jim.
They're right.

534
00:31:54,227 --> 00:31:56,473
I went out. I went out, and I came back.

535
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,536
And I came back with nothing.

536
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:00,949
I owe it to them.

537
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:03,026
- You owe?
- Yes.

538
00:32:03,052 --> 00:32:05,399
Tabitha, you just got back, and
now you wanna go back out there?

539
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,185
- It's not like she's gonna go
in the tree. - Exactly.

540
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:09,643
- Would you just stay outta this?
- I wanna go, too.

541
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:12,052
- No! Nobody is going to a tree.
- Jim!

542
00:32:14,163 --> 00:32:16,836
- I need to speak with you
for a minute, please. - Yeah.

543
00:32:20,436 --> 00:32:22,247
You need to think about
what you're doing.

544
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,515
I am.

545
00:32:24,801 --> 00:32:26,436
We thought you were dead.

546
00:32:27,209 --> 00:32:29,750
Your children thought you were dead.

547
00:32:29,828 --> 00:32:31,609
You think I give a shit
about what you owe

548
00:32:31,635 --> 00:32:33,070
to these people in a diner?

549
00:32:33,096 --> 00:32:34,970
You owe it to your kids to be here now.

550
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:37,094
I'm just gonna show him
where the tree is.

551
00:32:37,317 --> 00:32:38,561
That's all.

552
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:40,469
I'm not gonna go in.

553
00:32:41,105 --> 00:32:43,180
I'll be back. I promise.

554
00:32:45,482 --> 00:32:47,810
Fine, but Ethan...

555
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,741
he stays here with me.

556
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,772
Do you know he ran off looking
for you when you were gone?

557
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,420
Do you really wanna take him out there

558
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:58,045
and show him where the...
the magic tree is?

559
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,959
- Okay.
- Yeah.

560
00:33:01,985 --> 00:33:03,474
- Okay.
- Okay.

561
00:33:06,397 --> 00:33:07,513
Ethan,

562
00:33:08,677 --> 00:33:10,550
you're gonna stay here
with your father, okay?

563
00:33:10,576 --> 00:33:14,134
- But I wanna help.
- You're helping by staying here.

564
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,159
I'll be back soon.

565
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:18,037
- Let's go.
- I'll get my coat.

566
00:33:25,224 --> 00:33:26,326
Dad.

567
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,560
Stop, Dad!

568
00:33:30,532 --> 00:33:31,576
Come on.

569
00:33:33,447 --> 00:33:35,292
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- What?

570
00:33:35,318 --> 00:33:37,427
We are sitting on a powder keg in there,

571
00:33:37,453 --> 00:33:39,052
and you and Fatima are lighting matches.

572
00:33:39,078 --> 00:33:40,310
- She's upset.
- Oh, yeah?

573
00:33:40,336 --> 00:33:42,495
Well, guess what? We're
all fucking upset.

574
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,388
What we need to do is calm people down.

575
00:33:45,414 --> 00:33:48,636
Okay, or maybe what we need is for someone
around here to start doing something

576
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:51,349
instead of sitting around worrying
about what could go wrong.

577
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:54,659
Is that what I'm doing? I'm just
sitting around. Is that it?

578
00:33:54,685 --> 00:33:56,420
Maybe what we need is to
start taking chances.

579
00:33:56,446 --> 00:33:58,615
Oh, you wanna take some chances. Okay.

580
00:33:59,516 --> 00:34:01,365
Who you wanna take a chance on?

581
00:34:01,391 --> 00:34:04,448
Whose life are you willing to
take a chance to gamble on?

582
00:34:04,474 --> 00:34:06,825
- You know that's not what I'm saying.
- No, no! Tell me,

583
00:34:06,952 --> 00:34:08,396
'cause I wanna know!

584
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,537
Who we gonna march out there next?

585
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,248
You wanna do something, right?
So tell me! Who's next?

586
00:34:14,446 --> 00:34:15,779
Who's your pick?

587
00:34:16,592 --> 00:34:17,959
Who's your pick?

588
00:34:19,344 --> 00:34:20,584
Exactly.

589
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,303
What happened in there...

590
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,358
is a dangerous thing.

591
00:34:26,454 --> 00:34:27,779
It's a dangerous...

592
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:43,123
I never realized all this
stuff was down here.

593
00:34:43,696 --> 00:34:46,173
Yeah. This is where they store

594
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,076
the surplus of weird.

595
00:34:50,717 --> 00:34:52,537
I couldn't sleep one night,

596
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:55,248
and, I found this.

597
00:34:58,287 --> 00:34:59,678
Oh, my God.

598
00:35:02,631 --> 00:35:04,045
This is, like...

599
00:35:04,151 --> 00:35:06,212
It's, like, the vintage motherlode.

600
00:35:06,316 --> 00:35:08,662
Oh, no. No. It's not just vintage.

601
00:35:09,026 --> 00:35:10,334
This shit is...

602
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,154
This is '80s vintage.

603
00:35:15,568 --> 00:35:18,050
Can you imagine people
running through the woods

604
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:20,467
in, like, fluorescent spandex?

605
00:35:20,626 --> 00:35:23,662
With their big-ass hair getting
caught in the branches?

606
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:28,966
Hold on.

607
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:32,529
Oh, no way.

608
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,170
Wait. Wait.

609
00:35:36,022 --> 00:35:38,097
Like, come on.

610
00:35:38,131 --> 00:35:40,998
Yeah. Hey, that's it.
That's it right there.

611
00:35:41,024 --> 00:35:42,311
Yeah, right?

612
00:35:42,337 --> 00:35:44,014
Hey, check this out.

613
00:35:45,865 --> 00:35:48,631
Yeah. We're very post-apocalyptic chic.

614
00:35:50,778 --> 00:35:52,661
No. Don't do that.

615
00:35:57,838 --> 00:35:59,224
Oh, shit.

616
00:36:03,064 --> 00:36:04,568
Think it still works?

617
00:36:18,151 --> 00:36:19,462
Oh, no. This is mine.

618
00:36:19,488 --> 00:36:21,098
- What?
- Like...

619
00:36:21,202 --> 00:36:22,321
All right.

620
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:27,092
I'm keeping that.

621
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,876
No. You got one for yourself.

622
00:36:30,193 --> 00:36:31,384
Elgin.

623
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,766
Come on. Please?

624
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:36,845
- You have to come get it, then.
- That's not fair.

625
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,813
Sheriff Boyd?

626
00:36:47,348 --> 00:36:48,688
You got a second?

627
00:36:53,775 --> 00:36:56,467
I wanted to thank you for
what you said in there.

628
00:37:00,912 --> 00:37:03,014
I can't take back what I did.

629
00:37:03,286 --> 00:37:05,920
I know that, but I think I can help.

630
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:07,662
Oh, yeah?

631
00:37:08,857 --> 00:37:10,069
How's that?

632
00:37:10,551 --> 00:37:11,967
The meeting today...

633
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,855
Look, if you want them to
stop focusing on that tree,

634
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:16,795
you have to give them
something else to focus on,

635
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:18,592
a project or...

636
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,546
We had this really big storm.

637
00:37:20,678 --> 00:37:22,007
It hit the coast last year,

638
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:24,709
and it flooded half the town,
knocked out all the power.

639
00:37:24,735 --> 00:37:27,327
And people were scared. They were angry.

640
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:28,764
And so the precinct captain,

641
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:31,248
he got everyone out to
sandbag the marina.

642
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:34,467
The worst of the storm had already
passed, but it gave people...

643
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:36,186
it gave them something to focus on.

644
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,940
It made them feel like they
had some sort of control.

645
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:40,209
I see.

646
00:37:41,182 --> 00:37:45,561
So, you've been here less than a day,

647
00:37:45,951 --> 00:37:48,022
and already, you've got the solution.

648
00:37:48,116 --> 00:37:49,803
That's not what I'm saying.

649
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:51,889
- I'm just...
- You think I stuck up for you in there?

650
00:37:52,057 --> 00:37:54,091
You think we're buddies now?

651
00:37:54,713 --> 00:37:56,112
The one thing I agreed to

652
00:37:56,138 --> 00:37:58,807
was that you didn't belong
in that goddamn room.

653
00:37:58,924 --> 00:38:01,260
- What happened last night...
- You killed someone!

654
00:38:01,286 --> 00:38:03,609
And you left two people
to die in that ambulance.

655
00:38:03,635 --> 00:38:05,258
- I know!
- One of whom

656
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,885
you handcuffed to a fucking wall!

657
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,588
- I am sorry.
- Great!

658
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:12,963
Go be sorry, then. Try
not to kill anybody.

659
00:38:13,145 --> 00:38:16,479
You let me worry about how to
take care of my goddamn town.

660
00:38:16,637 --> 00:38:17,862
Thank you!

661
00:38:31,068 --> 00:38:32,234
Fuck.

662
00:38:34,586 --> 00:38:35,847
God.

663
00:38:55,636 --> 00:38:57,728
Baby, what are you... What's going on?

664
00:38:57,754 --> 00:39:00,691
- Hey, how did it go with your dad?
- It was fine. What are you doing?

665
00:39:01,894 --> 00:39:04,480
I was just, checking the supplies,

666
00:39:04,506 --> 00:39:06,027
- the crops and...
- Hey, hold on. Hold on.

667
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:07,691
- What? What do you want? What?
- Okay. Look.

668
00:39:07,717 --> 00:39:09,156
I'm trying to be supportive.

669
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:11,087
- Okay, so...
- And I'm trying...

670
00:39:11,113 --> 00:39:13,043
I'm trying to be patient, but I...

671
00:39:13,191 --> 00:39:15,511
- I need...
- You can't help.

672
00:39:15,996 --> 00:39:18,392
- What do you...
- You can't fucking help!

673
00:39:18,418 --> 00:39:20,207
Look, babe. I don't understand.

674
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,925
- Look! You...
- What do you mean I can't help?

675
00:39:21,951 --> 00:39:24,105
You can't fucking help! This.

676
00:39:25,683 --> 00:39:28,550
- This is all I can keep down.
- What?

677
00:39:28,778 --> 00:39:30,629
I think there's something wrong...

678
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,324
with the baby. I think there's
something wrong with the baby.

679
00:39:35,064 --> 00:39:37,465
Something's not right with the baby.

680
00:39:51,866 --> 00:39:53,284
What are you looking at?

681
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:59,696
Well, there's a motel sign here.

682
00:40:00,237 --> 00:40:01,915
There's a pool.

683
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:04,656
Where's the motel?

684
00:40:09,131 --> 00:40:10,915
Are you Victor's dad?

685
00:40:11,464 --> 00:40:12,689
That's right.

686
00:40:13,648 --> 00:40:15,939
You must be Ethan.

687
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:18,876
Your mom told me all about you.

688
00:40:19,269 --> 00:40:21,037
Thanks for bringing her back.

689
00:40:21,554 --> 00:40:22,805
I didn't...

690
00:40:24,928 --> 00:40:26,134
You're welcome.

691
00:40:26,943 --> 00:40:29,352
I'm going to the barn
to feed the animals.

692
00:40:29,604 --> 00:40:30,622
Wanna come?

693
00:40:30,686 --> 00:40:31,876
Sure.

694
00:40:40,594 --> 00:40:42,236
Have you seen Victor yet?

695
00:40:42,861 --> 00:40:43,892
No.

696
00:40:44,228 --> 00:40:47,650
I don't think he's very
happy that I'm here.

697
00:40:48,162 --> 00:40:49,236
Why?

698
00:40:50,096 --> 00:40:51,573
For one thing,

699
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,486
he found out I was here,
and he just ran off.

700
00:40:58,165 --> 00:41:00,751
He does stuff like that sometimes.

701
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,162
He gets really grumpy.

702
00:41:04,322 --> 00:41:06,196
I don't think he means to.

703
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:09,673
You know him pretty well, uh?

704
00:41:11,188 --> 00:41:12,759
He's my best friend.

705
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:20,212
Sometimes, he gets so grumpy,

706
00:41:20,663 --> 00:41:22,884
he says we can't be friends anymore.

707
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:25,954
But I think that's just
'cause he's scared.

708
00:41:27,478 --> 00:41:29,900
What do you think he's scared of?

709
00:41:32,472 --> 00:41:33,923
That I'm gonna die.

710
00:41:34,812 --> 00:41:37,032
Everyone he ever loved here died.

711
00:41:42,173 --> 00:41:43,977
I can come with you,

712
00:41:44,661 --> 00:41:45,892
if you want,

713
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,374
up to Colony House. You don't have to...

714
00:41:51,689 --> 00:41:52,853
What's wrong?

715
00:41:58,364 --> 00:41:59,836
Oh, there's Victor.

716
00:42:16,813 --> 00:42:17,856
It's okay.

717
00:42:19,729 --> 00:42:21,111
Everything's okay.

718
00:42:47,836 --> 00:42:49,027
Victor?

719
00:42:54,428 --> 00:42:55,561
Victor.

720
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:05,907
Hey, hey, hey.

721
00:43:06,009 --> 00:43:07,302
No, no.

722
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:10,439
Oh, God.

723
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,837
I didn't know how to get home.

724
00:43:25,312 --> 00:43:27,220
I didn't know how to get home.

725
00:43:27,246 --> 00:43:28,705
It's okay.

726
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,576
It's okay.

727
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,489
What are you doing in here?

728
00:44:34,111 --> 00:44:35,294
Just...

729
00:44:37,485 --> 00:44:38,787
I don't know.

730
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:42,013
Trying to assuage my guilt, I guess.

731
00:44:43,827 --> 00:44:46,013
What happened last night
wasn't your fault,

732
00:44:46,946 --> 00:44:49,423
and I'm sorry I wasn't more
supportive at the meeting.

733
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:51,404
People have a right to ask questions.

734
00:44:51,577 --> 00:44:54,145
I'm just tired of being the
guy without any answers.

735
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,198
Something about that funny to you?

736
00:44:58,224 --> 00:45:00,255
Sorry. It's just,

737
00:45:01,605 --> 00:45:03,279
you sound like my sister.

738
00:45:03,902 --> 00:45:05,575
She was always...

739
00:45:08,107 --> 00:45:09,669
She was someone

740
00:45:10,718 --> 00:45:13,748
who tried so hard to
make everything right,

741
00:45:15,069 --> 00:45:17,818
and she always ended up
feeling like she was wrong.

742
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,802
The way everyone's acting in there,

743
00:45:20,828 --> 00:45:23,591
it's like they wanna
go home and you don't.

744
00:45:24,529 --> 00:45:27,560
You're trying to keep people
from doing something stupid.

745
00:45:29,138 --> 00:45:32,044
I just want you to know that
I'll have your back next time.

746
00:45:32,456 --> 00:45:34,500
Yeah. Thank you.

747
00:45:37,284 --> 00:45:38,521
Come on.

748
00:45:38,864 --> 00:45:40,505
Oh, goddamn it!

749
00:45:41,734 --> 00:45:44,935
Hey, I don't suppose you
wanna climb up here

750
00:45:45,154 --> 00:45:47,576
- and maybe help me...
- They're just numbers.

751
00:45:48,794 --> 00:45:52,248
No, no, no. But look. Look.

752
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:56,318
Every single slip of paper has
four numbers on it, right?

753
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,544
What if they're not just numbers?

754
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:00,490
What if they're dates?

755
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,845
This one says 2659.

756
00:46:06,709 --> 00:46:08,904
I don't know, Jade. Maybe Jim's right.

757
00:46:09,513 --> 00:46:11,724
How do we know that everything that...

758
00:46:12,286 --> 00:46:13,310
I...

759
00:46:21,258 --> 00:46:22,992
I saw your freaky kids, you know.

760
00:46:25,272 --> 00:46:26,297
Really?

761
00:46:26,908 --> 00:46:28,015
Where?

762
00:46:28,293 --> 00:46:29,821
Down in the tunnels.

763
00:46:30,493 --> 00:46:32,375
I went down there the day you...

764
00:46:32,811 --> 00:46:35,477
I was hoping to find
something to help Julie.

765
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,039
Instead, I saw this.

766
00:46:43,071 --> 00:46:45,477
Turns out it wasn't a symbol.
It was a hole in the ceiling,

767
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,438
and these slashes

768
00:46:47,803 --> 00:46:49,327
were roots.

769
00:46:52,321 --> 00:46:53,773
And those kids...

770
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:58,336
they were laid out on slabs of stone,

771
00:46:58,876 --> 00:47:03,789
repeating that word over and over again.

772
00:47:03,842 --> 00:47:05,156
Anghkooey.

773
00:47:06,859 --> 00:47:08,697
When I tell you I felt
fear in that moment

774
00:47:08,723 --> 00:47:11,156
like I've never felt in my life...

775
00:47:13,015 --> 00:47:14,469
But there was also this...

776
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:18,563
this glimpse of something that I
knew was there but I couldn't...

777
00:47:19,094 --> 00:47:21,555
Even with all the fucking
horror, it was like,

778
00:47:21,789 --> 00:47:23,664
for the first time,

779
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,414
I felt like there were threads

780
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:30,344
that were finally starting to connect.

781
00:47:31,311 --> 00:47:32,719
Connect how?

782
00:47:35,554 --> 00:47:36,813
I don't know.

783
00:47:38,278 --> 00:47:40,380
Piecing this together, it's like, it's,

784
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:43,110
it's like trying to grab hold of water.

785
00:47:44,664 --> 00:47:46,242
These numbers in these bottles,

786
00:47:46,268 --> 00:47:48,625
they might seem like this tree.

787
00:47:49,547 --> 00:47:52,258
There is no denying what this tree did,

788
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:54,685
and the fact that someone took the time

789
00:47:54,711 --> 00:47:57,961
to put these bottles here,
to put these numbers here...

790
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:01,641
It only looks like chaos

791
00:48:02,111 --> 00:48:04,406
until you understand the pattern.

792
00:48:07,101 --> 00:48:09,319
So, this is the mysterious tree, uh?

793
00:48:10,602 --> 00:48:12,054
Fuck me.

794
00:48:17,551 --> 00:48:19,091
Bottles are a nice touch.

795
00:48:19,493 --> 00:48:20,982
What are you doing here?

796
00:48:22,238 --> 00:48:23,490
This is it?

797
00:48:30,118 --> 00:48:32,028
I just... just go in here?

798
00:48:32,054 --> 00:48:34,756
I really... I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

799
00:48:36,193 --> 00:48:37,284
Well...

800
00:48:38,474 --> 00:48:39,763
you're not me.

801
00:48:40,575 --> 00:48:42,349
And that's why you're
gonna be sitting here

802
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:44,678
with your thumb up your
ass while I'm back home

803
00:48:44,704 --> 00:48:47,425
figuring out how to get help
for everybody back here.

804
00:48:48,627 --> 00:48:50,607
See, that's what a
smart person would do.

805
00:48:52,883 --> 00:48:54,006
Dale.

806
00:48:54,888 --> 00:48:56,521
Dale! Dale.

807
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:58,365
Dale. Dale.

808
00:48:59,914 --> 00:49:00,943
Look.

809
00:49:01,353 --> 00:49:03,170
Somebody's gotta try, right?

810
00:49:05,659 --> 00:49:08,389
It's okay. You guys can thank me later.

811
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:25,126
Look, Boyd. If you need anything,
just, you know, just...

812
00:49:28,197 --> 00:49:29,632
He's over here!

813
00:49:29,658 --> 00:49:31,485
Yeah! Someone's over here!

814
00:49:32,126 --> 00:49:33,309
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

815
00:49:33,335 --> 00:49:34,795
All right, everybody.

816
00:49:34,821 --> 00:49:37,829
Everyone just back up.
Move back. Back up.

817
00:49:39,956 --> 00:49:41,274
Oh, Jesus.

818
00:49:57,532 --> 00:49:58,748
Okay.

819
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:00,748
Okay.

820
00:50:03,587 --> 00:50:05,256
Can you help him?

821
00:50:08,035 --> 00:50:09,044
Okay.

822
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,116
Okay. Okay.

823
00:50:11,312 --> 00:50:13,030
Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me...

824
00:50:14,467 --> 00:50:15,739
Let me...

825
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:19,076
I'm sorry, Dale.

826
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:22,295
I'm so sorry this happened to you.

827
00:50:24,149 --> 00:50:25,709
Oh, fuck.

828
00:51:16,636 --> 00:51:17,614
Okay.

829
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,333
All right. Who's...

830
00:51:21,648 --> 00:51:22,700
who's next?

831
00:51:24,482 --> 00:51:26,185
Still wanna go through the tree?

832
00:51:27,188 --> 00:51:28,482
Go ahead, then!

833
00:51:29,248 --> 00:51:31,000
Who the fuck is next?!

834
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:37,104
You think I wanna do this?!

835
00:51:37,648 --> 00:51:41,464
You think I wanna be the one who...

836
00:51:42,886 --> 00:51:46,786
I am trying to keep you alive!

837
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,495
Don't you see that?!

838
00:51:49,672 --> 00:51:52,503
I can't help you if you don't let me!

839
00:51:52,608 --> 00:51:53,925
I can't...

840
00:51:57,541 --> 00:51:58,760
Hey...
