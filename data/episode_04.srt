Previously on From...

3
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:11,893
This was Meghan's favorite spot.

4
00:00:11,898 --> 00:00:13,642
You'll bury me next to them, right?

5
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:16,251
Of course. Frank.
The box. I can't do it.

6
00:00:16,256 --> 00:00:17,491
How do you think people are gonna react

7
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:18,795
when you let Frank go?

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,277
Aren't you supposed to be talking to me

9
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:22,181
about the virtues of mercy?

10
00:00:22,186 --> 00:00:23,240
Is that what you'd prefer?

11
00:00:23,245 --> 00:00:25,704
Hey, I'd prefer not to put a broken man

12
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:29,483
in a fucking box to be torn
apart when the sun goes down!

13
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,923
But you built a guillotine
in the town square.

14
00:00:31,928 --> 00:00:33,551
What do you think happens
when people realize

15
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:35,600
you lack the conviction to use it?

16
00:00:35,605 --> 00:00:39,038
You take that and you make
whatever life you can out there.

17
00:00:39,043 --> 00:00:41,775
So, you're telling me
I'm in a town I can't leave

18
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,165
and that every night
monsters come from the forest.

19
00:00:47,095 --> 00:00:49,197
No one is trying to be cruel to you.

20
00:00:49,202 --> 00:00:50,962
But you need to
understand what's going on.

21
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,913
Oh God. Tobey?

22
00:00:52,918 --> 00:00:53,998
What are you doing?

23
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:56,181
I'm checking to see if they've moved.

24
00:00:56,186 --> 00:00:57,874
- If what moved?
- The trees.

25
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:00,664
Have you seen the boy who
lives out here? We're friends.

26
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:02,101
If you see that friend of yours,

27
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:04,581
tell him Victor says hello.

28
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:07,144
Sara... just tell me what you did.

29
00:01:07,265 --> 00:01:09,076
I left the door open.

30
00:01:09,964 --> 00:01:12,413
All newcomers have to decide
where they're gonna live:

31
00:01:12,418 --> 00:01:14,986
here in Colony House
or down in the town.

32
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,077
It's just part of how we do things here.

33
00:01:17,183 --> 00:01:20,538
I'd like to take the both
of you, show you around.

34
00:01:20,543 --> 00:01:21,666
Well, I wanna come.

35
00:01:21,671 --> 00:01:22,885
This is about all of us, right?

36
00:01:22,889 --> 00:01:24,453
- I wanna see.
- We need you to stay here

37
00:01:24,457 --> 00:01:27,100
- and be with Ethan.
- Three, two, one.

38
00:01:27,105 --> 00:01:29,538
Why are you doing this?
You guys barely know us.

39
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:30,762
It's just what we do.

40
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:32,959
Are you living in town or Colony House?

41
00:01:32,964 --> 00:01:33,971
Town.

42
00:01:33,976 --> 00:01:36,272
- Julie.
- Colony House.

43
00:01:36,277 --> 00:01:39,062
- Why are you doing this?
- Girl made her choice.

44
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:40,992
I appreciate everything
you're trying to do for me.

45
00:01:40,996 --> 00:01:43,316
But the only two things that
I love in this world are gone.

46
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:45,139
I wanna see my girls again.

47
00:04:39,183 --> 00:04:41,682
You know how sometimes
you dream and you forget,

48
00:04:41,687 --> 00:04:44,448
but then, later, you start to remember,

49
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:46,324
and you realize that it wasn't a dream

50
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:50,143
and that all of it maybe really happens?

51
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:51,786
Uh, um...

52
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,323
I think I'm starting to remember things,

53
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,229
things that I thought were dreams.

54
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,112
I made you a drawing.

55
00:05:06,696 --> 00:05:08,924
You can keep it if you want.

56
00:05:18,043 --> 00:05:20,607
Well, good morning, sleepy head.

57
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,271
It's about time you woke up.

58
00:05:22,276 --> 00:05:23,916
Can I have my pillow back?

59
00:05:24,398 --> 00:05:27,911
Your... Oh, I'm so sorry.

60
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,969
Someone just gave this to me
last night. I didn't realize.

61
00:05:29,973 --> 00:05:32,013
Oh, no. It's totally fine.
I just want to take a nap

62
00:05:32,018 --> 00:05:34,489
and it's sort of like a security
blanket for me, you know?

63
00:05:34,494 --> 00:05:37,146
Yeah, I totally get it. I'm sorry again.

64
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,544
Don't even worry about it.

65
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:41,463
Mi pillow, su pillow, or something.

66
00:05:42,154 --> 00:05:44,096
Her name's Meredith.

67
00:05:45,698 --> 00:05:48,826
Oh, the pillow. You named your pillow.

68
00:05:48,831 --> 00:05:49,944
Uh-huh.

69
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,791
The things that matter to
you should always have names.

70
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:55,862
Yeah, totally.

71
00:05:57,081 --> 00:05:58,591
You know, it's kinda funny,

72
00:05:58,596 --> 00:06:00,264
I have a shirt just like that.

73
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:02,581
Oh, I know, I got this
out of your suitcase.

74
00:06:02,957 --> 00:06:04,132
What?

75
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,677
You don't mind, do you?

76
00:06:06,127 --> 00:06:08,063
We share everything here.

77
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,201
I guess not.

78
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:12,307
Thanks for taking care of Meredith.

79
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,276
Jesus.

80
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:32,698
Hey.

81
00:07:33,393 --> 00:07:34,875
You sleep?

82
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,932
Yeah, I think so. I made some tea.

83
00:07:38,754 --> 00:07:39,948
Let's get some light in here.

84
00:07:39,953 --> 00:07:42,018
Oh, please no. Not yet.

85
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,992
Okay.

86
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,737
I used to love this time of morning.

87
00:07:51,624 --> 00:07:53,147
I remember.

88
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,215
Sometimes he'd stop crying
just as the sun was coming up.

89
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,784
It was like he was saying...

90
00:08:04,992 --> 00:08:07,120
"You've been up all night;
my work here is done."

91
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:18,190
Do you think we're being punished?

92
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:21,679
Why would you say that?

93
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:26,943
Jim, I'm drinking tea
out of a dead woman's mug,

94
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:29,885
in a place that can't possibly exist...

95
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,182
in a house where another child died.

96
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:37,924
Julie's off doing God knows what.

97
00:08:42,044 --> 00:08:43,830
What are we gonna do?

98
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,772
I don't know.

99
00:08:45,777 --> 00:08:47,802
Are you crying, Mom?

100
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:52,896
No, honey. I just...
I just have a headache.

101
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:53,959
Come here.

102
00:08:54,573 --> 00:08:56,053
Sit in my lap.

103
00:08:56,914 --> 00:08:58,601
I miss Julie.

104
00:09:01,227 --> 00:09:03,099
Hey, why don't we
go down to that diner?

105
00:09:03,354 --> 00:09:05,618
The sheriff said they serve
a big community breakfast

106
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:07,441
there every morning.
What do you say? You hungry?

107
00:09:07,445 --> 00:09:08,753
- Yeah.
- All right.

108
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:10,612
- Let's do that.
- That's a great idea.

109
00:09:11,494 --> 00:09:13,104
Yeah, you can...

110
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:15,963
You can go and-and
bring me something back.

111
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,666
What are you gonna do?

112
00:09:18,756 --> 00:09:21,400
I, um... I'm going to...

113
00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:24,952
I'm going to unpack.

114
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:26,658
Just organize our stuff.

115
00:09:26,663 --> 00:09:28,307
- You sure?
- Yeah.

116
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:34,838
Okay. Saddle up, partner.
Let's go get some pancakes.

117
00:09:34,843 --> 00:09:37,019
You think they'll have pancakes?

118
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:39,635
Well, I've never been
to a diner that didn't.

119
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,166
What are you gonna get?

120
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:45,173
Guess I'll have to look at the menu.

121
00:10:14,444 --> 00:10:16,750
Do you think they'll
have whipped cream?

122
00:10:16,755 --> 00:10:19,650
Uh, well, we'll soon find out.

123
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,268
Hi, Sheriff!

124
00:10:22,697 --> 00:10:26,049
Uh, morning. Where are you
two fine gentlemen heading?

125
00:10:26,054 --> 00:10:28,056
Oh, we're just off to get breakfast.

126
00:10:28,672 --> 00:10:30,413
What's in the cart?

127
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:34,408
Uh, nothing. Just, uh, some supplies.

128
00:10:34,413 --> 00:10:37,982
Gotta go over to the church,
take 'em to Father Khatri.

129
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,095
Do you need help?

130
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,447
No, thanks. You should hurry on now.

131
00:10:42,452 --> 00:10:44,893
Mrs. Liu is very strict
about breakfast hours.

132
00:10:44,898 --> 00:10:45,994
Don't wanna miss it.

133
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:47,171
All right. You have a good day.

134
00:10:47,175 --> 00:10:49,177
- Take care now.
- Okay.

135
00:10:59,932 --> 00:11:01,283
Hi there.

136
00:11:01,752 --> 00:11:03,549
We were hoping you'd come by today.

137
00:11:03,554 --> 00:11:05,064
Mrs. Liu always likes to try

138
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:07,729
and make something
special for our newcomers.

139
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:10,330
Ah, that's... Thank you.
That's very nice.

140
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:11,620
It's appreciated.

141
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:15,057
- I'm Sara.
- Jim Matthews.

142
00:11:15,062 --> 00:11:17,586
And you must be Ethan.

143
00:11:17,717 --> 00:11:19,932
I heard all about your heroic adventure

144
00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:21,494
out in the woods the other night.

145
00:11:21,655 --> 00:11:26,477
Come on, you guys can sit at
our very special VIP table.

146
00:11:26,482 --> 00:11:28,267
Do you have pancakes?

147
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,796
I'll have to check
with the boss and see.

148
00:11:30,801 --> 00:11:32,626
Mrs. Liu is kind of a genius.

149
00:11:32,631 --> 00:11:34,647
She could probably
make a Salisbury steak

150
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,094
from a tire iron.

151
00:11:37,598 --> 00:11:39,329
Liu...

152
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,946
she's the one with the husband the...

153
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,633
the other night in the clinic?

154
00:11:43,638 --> 00:11:47,048
Right. Yeah, that was... um...

155
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:48,649
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't...
- No.

156
00:11:48,654 --> 00:11:50,177
- I shouldn't...
- No, it's okay.

157
00:11:50,338 --> 00:11:51,923
I, um...

158
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,212
I should go check on those pancakes.

159
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,055
Told you they'd have pancakes.

160
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:21,376
They don't leave much, do they?

161
00:12:23,235 --> 00:12:25,343
Just make sure he's
buried with his family.

162
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:26,938
Yeah.

163
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,733
You're not coming back for the service?

164
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:35,173
I'm sorry, is something funny?

165
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:38,361
You gonna mention in your little service

166
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:39,925
how you're the one who wanted him dead?

167
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:43,946
Feel better now?

168
00:12:44,673 --> 00:12:46,251
Hm?

169
00:12:46,663 --> 00:12:48,727
Just bring back the
cart when you're done.

170
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,071
Uh, Jade?

171
00:13:00,253 --> 00:13:01,696
Jade.

172
00:13:02,594 --> 00:13:04,008
I, uh...

173
00:13:04,637 --> 00:13:07,344
I knocked on your door to
get you for some breakfast.

174
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,977
What are you doing out here?

175
00:13:13,883 --> 00:13:15,649
I wanna show you something.

176
00:13:17,109 --> 00:13:18,790
That? That's, uh... That's empty.

177
00:13:18,795 --> 00:13:21,024
Yeah. That's kinda the point. Come on.

178
00:13:23,813 --> 00:13:25,329
Okay.

179
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,626
I thought it was some
kind of CGI party trick.

180
00:13:30,631 --> 00:13:31,877
There was this... They were right here,

181
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:33,916
there was this weird fucking
symbol right on the ceiling.

182
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,438
And over here, right?
This is where the body was.

183
00:13:36,443 --> 00:13:39,024
It was a guy right here. Dead, right?

184
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:42,891
Fucking half-crushed by this giant...

185
00:13:43,428 --> 00:13:46,962
Giant boulder thing! And
then, he starts screaming!

186
00:13:48,469 --> 00:13:49,687
Don't. No, come on.

187
00:13:49,692 --> 00:13:51,009
Don't look at me like
I'm fucking crazy, okay?

188
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:52,013
I know what I saw!

189
00:13:52,018 --> 00:13:53,977
I'm not. I'm not. It's just...

190
00:13:54,455 --> 00:13:57,907
Look, the first couple
days can be really tough,

191
00:13:57,912 --> 00:13:58,945
for everyone.

192
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,228
- No, no, no!
- It's like your brain can't really

193
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:02,399
understand what's going on and...

194
00:14:02,404 --> 00:14:04,399
Listen, I wasn't hallucinating, okay?

195
00:14:04,404 --> 00:14:06,610
Trust me, I've done a fuck ton of drugs,

196
00:14:06,615 --> 00:14:08,291
I know what hallucinations
feel like. This was different.

197
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:10,798
It was here and then it wasn't.

198
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,590
I have a pretty healthy
imagination, okay?

199
00:14:14,595 --> 00:14:16,379
I mean, I built a software company

200
00:14:16,384 --> 00:14:19,438
based on nothing but
imagination. But this?

201
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:21,010
None of this is...

202
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:26,953
There has got to be an explanation

203
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,188
and none of you fucking people
seem to be looking for it.

204
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:37,360
Okay. Um, why don't we go
back to the sheriff's station?

205
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,993
'Kay? I wanna show you
something now. Come on.

206
00:14:42,322 --> 00:14:43,805
Come on.

207
00:14:54,886 --> 00:14:56,610
Whoa.

208
00:14:56,615 --> 00:14:58,063
What do you say?

209
00:14:58,068 --> 00:14:59,373
Thank you!

210
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:01,032
Enjoy!

211
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:06,500
Oh, I'll... I'll just take
a little bit of his, thanks.

212
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:19,579
- Pretty good, huh?
- Yeah.

213
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:23,235
See? Not everything's so bad here, huh?

214
00:15:25,084 --> 00:15:26,719
Do we live here now?

215
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:28,446
No, no.

216
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:33,332
No. Uh, we're just
here for a little bit.

217
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:36,123
You know what? Think of it
like, um... like a vacation.

218
00:15:36,605 --> 00:15:39,160
I think it's probably a quest.

219
00:15:39,663 --> 00:15:40,762
What?

220
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:42,504
Like a hero's quest?

221
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:45,120
Like Norman had to go
on to the Lake of Tears?

222
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,688
We probably have to save
somebody if we want to go home.

223
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:51,087
That's what Norman had to do.

224
00:15:51,092 --> 00:15:53,332
Yeah, you might be onto something there.

225
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:56,129
Sometimes I pretend
that's where Thomas went.

226
00:15:58,868 --> 00:16:00,043
What?

227
00:16:00,048 --> 00:16:02,645
That he's on a magical quest,

228
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:06,348
and if I try, I can help
him save the kingdom.

229
00:16:08,632 --> 00:16:10,371
Is that right?

230
00:16:15,545 --> 00:16:17,676
Um... Look, uh...

231
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:19,777
I'm gonna go to the
restroom for a moment.

232
00:16:19,782 --> 00:16:22,621
You just sit here and hang
tight, okay? I'll be right back.

233
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:23,932
Hang tight.

234
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:28,434
Excuse me, where's the, uh...

235
00:17:33,564 --> 00:17:34,914
Four inches.

236
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,614
What?

237
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:37,762
The trees,

238
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,420
they've moved four inches.

239
00:17:39,703 --> 00:17:41,426
Is that good or bad?

240
00:17:41,431 --> 00:17:43,651
They're close, so it's bad.

241
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,723
Should we tell somebody?

242
00:17:45,728 --> 00:17:47,739
Oh, I don't think they'll understand.

243
00:17:49,237 --> 00:17:51,317
There's something I need to show you,

244
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:53,387
something very important.

245
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:57,210
You remember the boy that
you were talking about?

246
00:17:57,215 --> 00:17:59,505
The one that lives outside?

247
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:02,539
Is that him?

248
00:18:07,496 --> 00:18:09,036
Who drew this?

249
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,450
I did.

250
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:12,731
But it's in crayon.

251
00:18:12,736 --> 00:18:13,912
So?

252
00:18:14,763 --> 00:18:16,637
You're a grown-up.

253
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,739
Is it him or not?

254
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,809
That's him.

255
00:18:27,735 --> 00:18:29,519
What's wrong?

256
00:18:31,465 --> 00:18:33,380
That means he was real.

257
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:35,169
Hey.

258
00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:36,701
Hey!

259
00:18:36,706 --> 00:18:38,450
It's okay, Dad.

260
00:18:40,408 --> 00:18:41,409
Let me see that.

261
00:18:41,414 --> 00:18:42,848
- I'm sorry.
- Hold on.

262
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:44,169
- I wasn't...
- Hold on.

263
00:18:44,174 --> 00:18:45,598
What is this? What're you doing?

264
00:18:45,603 --> 00:18:47,126
Excuse me.

265
00:18:47,328 --> 00:18:49,825
Dad, stop! What are you doing?

266
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,583
- Dad!
- You don't come near him.

267
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,364
You don't talk to him.
Do you understand me?

268
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:54,459
I would never do anything...

269
00:18:54,463 --> 00:18:57,208
The only thing you say
right now is "Yes." Okay?

270
00:18:57,213 --> 00:18:58,747
- I'm sorry.
- He's a kid.

271
00:18:58,752 --> 00:19:00,278
Stay the fuck away from him.

272
00:19:01,197 --> 00:19:02,764
Dad!

273
00:19:06,872 --> 00:19:08,716
Why'd you do that?

274
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:12,450
Time to go.

275
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:16,882
Come on. Let's go.

276
00:19:30,806 --> 00:19:33,419
There you are. Been
looking everywhere for you.

277
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,747
What's wrong?

278
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:40,665
Um, I think maybe I made a mistake.

279
00:19:44,286 --> 00:19:46,630
It was hard for me too at first.

280
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:49,669
Tell you a secret...

281
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:51,522
It helped once I figured out

282
00:19:51,527 --> 00:19:53,426
how to get my clothes back from Trudy.

283
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:55,736
How did you know that...

284
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:56,787
Well, she's wearing a new T-shirt

285
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,255
and I know she didn't
order that online so...

286
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:04,384
Come on.

287
00:20:05,763 --> 00:20:07,286
Up, up, up.

288
00:20:14,685 --> 00:20:17,591
Take it easy on that leg or
you're gonna pop a stitch.

289
00:20:18,143 --> 00:20:19,971
You shouldn't have done that.

290
00:20:20,343 --> 00:20:22,325
Victor's my friend.

291
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:25,077
Look, I'm sorry.

292
00:20:25,082 --> 00:20:26,823
Just leave me alone.

293
00:20:41,951 --> 00:20:43,669
You see that one right there?

294
00:20:43,674 --> 00:20:46,184
- Which one?
- The black one, right there.

295
00:20:46,189 --> 00:20:48,528
- Uh, yes.
- That one is Armani.

296
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:51,028
It belonged to this guy
Charlie, from Duluth.

297
00:20:51,077 --> 00:20:54,247
Oh, God, he was this
amazing cross-dresser.

298
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:57,380
Oh, he was so beautiful and funny.

299
00:20:57,385 --> 00:21:00,214
Ah! Anyway, when he...

300
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:03,676
Well, Trudy got her hands on it,

301
00:21:03,681 --> 00:21:05,380
and now she's always trying to hide it,

302
00:21:05,385 --> 00:21:07,442
so she doesn't have to
share it with anybody.

303
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:09,567
Since you're on laundry detail...

304
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:10,573
It's up for grabs.

305
00:21:10,578 --> 00:21:13,544
It's up for grabs! Here, put it on.

306
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:15,551
I've never worn Armani before.

307
00:21:15,556 --> 00:21:16,949
Well, I think Charlie would agree

308
00:21:16,954 --> 00:21:19,364
it would look much better
on you than it does on Trudy.

309
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:21,051
Stop it.

310
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:23,950
Ms. Matthews!

311
00:21:25,135 --> 00:21:26,919
It looks nice!

312
00:21:27,613 --> 00:21:29,028
What?

313
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,148
If you want, I can go talk...

314
00:21:33,153 --> 00:21:34,801
No, it's fine. I got it.

315
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,021
Hey.

316
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:45,566
Hi.

317
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,348
What are you doing up here?

318
00:21:48,153 --> 00:21:51,722
Well, I found your sweater in my bag.

319
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:58,778
We miss you.

320
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:03,403
I miss you guys. too.

321
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:08,463
Then come back with me.

322
00:22:09,534 --> 00:22:12,747
Honey, this is not a prison.
You can leave whenever you want.

323
00:22:13,634 --> 00:22:14,891
We'll...

324
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:16,114
We'll talk to Donna about,

325
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:19,091
you know, you made a mistake,
that you've changed your mind.

326
00:22:19,096 --> 00:22:20,140
I did...

327
00:22:21,756 --> 00:22:23,528
Why do you always do that?

328
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:24,969
- Do what?
- You make it seem like

329
00:22:24,974 --> 00:22:27,767
poor, stupid Julie doesn't
understand what she's doing

330
00:22:27,772 --> 00:22:29,643
and that everything will just be okay

331
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,790
once I admit that I was wrong,
like I always have to do.

332
00:22:32,795 --> 00:22:34,449
I didn't say that. I didn't say that.

333
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:35,635
Yeah. You know what? Forget it.

334
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:36,861
I really don't want to do this.

335
00:22:36,865 --> 00:22:39,540
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Julie. Julie.

336
00:22:40,003 --> 00:22:42,438
We have no idea where we are,
how we got here.

337
00:22:42,443 --> 00:22:44,657
We have to stick together as a family.

338
00:22:45,962 --> 00:22:47,946
Are you kidding me?

339
00:22:48,095 --> 00:22:49,488
You're seriously gonna stand there

340
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,368
and lecture me about family?

341
00:22:52,354 --> 00:22:53,616
I knew.

342
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,602
I knew what you and Dad were planning.

343
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,688
I knew all about the divorce

344
00:22:57,693 --> 00:22:59,573
and how this whole trip
was just one last hurrah

345
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,384
before you sat us
down to break the news.

346
00:23:01,389 --> 00:23:03,876
So stop treating me like I'm a child.

347
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:05,813
Okay, okay, Julie.

348
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,809
You're right.

349
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:16,517
Look, your father and I
love each other very much.

350
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:18,712
We love you and Ethan very, very much.

351
00:23:18,717 --> 00:23:21,548
Thomas is dead! Okay?

352
00:23:21,685 --> 00:23:23,188
And I know that it's hard,

353
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,985
and I know that you
lost, but we all lost.

354
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:28,906
You have two other kids!

355
00:23:28,911 --> 00:23:30,259
Why aren't we enough for you?

356
00:23:30,264 --> 00:23:32,368
It's not that simple!
It's not that simple!

357
00:23:32,373 --> 00:23:34,157
I can't do this right now. Please, I...

358
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,903
I'm not trying to make
this more di... I'm sorry.

359
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,927
- I'll make sure she gets it.
- Yeah. Yeah.

360
00:23:56,421 --> 00:23:58,009
What the fuck is this?

361
00:23:58,014 --> 00:23:59,970
This, near as we could guess,

362
00:23:59,975 --> 00:24:01,197
is where you and your
friend were driving

363
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:02,493
when you reached the tree.

364
00:24:02,498 --> 00:24:04,571
But the RV that the family came in?

365
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,012
They were driving here.

366
00:24:06,017 --> 00:24:07,579
- Okay.
- Me and my parents,

367
00:24:07,584 --> 00:24:09,063
we were in Austin, Texas.

368
00:24:09,068 --> 00:24:11,798
Kristi, the medic? She was in Detroit.

369
00:24:12,447 --> 00:24:15,626
Every single one of these
pins is a different resident

370
00:24:15,631 --> 00:24:17,931
who drove in from a different location.

371
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:20,192
Yet somehow we all ended up here.

372
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,642
That is fucking impossible.

373
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:27,110
Yeah.

374
00:24:33,991 --> 00:24:35,587
Okay.

375
00:24:35,592 --> 00:24:36,898
All right. Well, see?

376
00:24:36,903 --> 00:24:38,556
That's the difference
between you and me.

377
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:40,520
- I don't do impossible.
- Right.

378
00:24:40,525 --> 00:24:44,806
I don't just sit around,
accepting the world as it is!

379
00:24:47,048 --> 00:24:49,079
Someone is doing this,

380
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:51,954
and I'm not gonna rest
until I figure out how.

381
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:54,743
Well, then you're gonna
lose your mind. Okay?

382
00:24:54,748 --> 00:24:57,524
Because that's what happens
to people who can't adapt.

383
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,053
They can't bend,

384
00:24:59,058 --> 00:25:02,322
so eventually they break. Jade, look,

385
00:25:02,327 --> 00:25:04,242
every new person who
comes here just assumes

386
00:25:04,247 --> 00:25:06,815
that it's just the monsters
they have to be afraid of,

387
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,704
but that's not the hardest part.

388
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:12,847
It's what this place does to you,

389
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,837
what it makes you think and feel,

390
00:25:17,842 --> 00:25:19,931
what it makes you question
about every single thing

391
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:23,063
that you think you know,
and-and if you can't if you...

392
00:25:26,206 --> 00:25:27,990
Yeah, it does that sometimes.

393
00:25:27,995 --> 00:25:29,477
Look, I'm just trying to tell you,

394
00:25:29,482 --> 00:25:32,173
if-if you can't understand that...

395
00:25:33,546 --> 00:25:37,212
What are you...? Wait,
where are you going?

396
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:39,438
Jade!

397
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:50,298
Well, you look how I feel.

398
00:25:53,222 --> 00:25:54,919
Ethan's mad at me.

399
00:25:54,924 --> 00:25:56,274
Why?

400
00:25:57,574 --> 00:25:58,836
I, uh...

401
00:26:01,915 --> 00:26:03,767
I thought you were gonna unpack.

402
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:07,290
Yeah, I was. But I went to see Julie.

403
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:10,204
How'd that go?

404
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,009
Well, as well as you'd expect.

405
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:19,221
She knows.

406
00:26:20,295 --> 00:26:21,862
What?

407
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:23,467
She knows about
the fucking divorce, Jim.

408
00:26:23,472 --> 00:26:24,798
She fucking knows.

409
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,727
Everything's gonna be okay.

410
00:26:30,732 --> 00:26:32,532
Oh, please stop saying that.

411
00:26:32,537 --> 00:26:34,774
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't know!

412
00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:36,761
Say that-that you're...

413
00:26:36,766 --> 00:26:38,907
That you're hurt, that you're scared.

414
00:26:38,961 --> 00:26:42,017
That this is all so fucked that
you have no idea what to do,

415
00:26:42,022 --> 00:26:45,199
because I am walking around,
reminding myself to breathe,

416
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,250
and every time you talk about

417
00:26:47,255 --> 00:26:50,962
how things are going to be okay,
it makes the rest of us feel

418
00:26:50,967 --> 00:26:52,287
that we're doing something wrong.

419
00:26:52,292 --> 00:26:53,813
That's not fair!

420
00:26:55,884 --> 00:26:57,227
Fair?

421
00:26:57,232 --> 00:27:00,915
I'm sorry, what part of the
last 14 months have been fair?

422
00:27:01,091 --> 00:27:03,136
I'm tryin' to keep
a grip on things here.

423
00:27:03,141 --> 00:27:05,181
It's not gonna do us any
good if we get hysterical.

424
00:27:05,186 --> 00:27:07,173
No. You don't get to do that.

425
00:27:07,178 --> 00:27:09,352
I am not being hysterical.

426
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,376
We wouldn't even be here if we hadn't...

427
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:12,382
What?

428
00:27:13,881 --> 00:27:15,448
Just forget it.

429
00:27:15,453 --> 00:27:18,423
Go ahead and say it. Say it to my face.

430
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:22,096
What was this trip
supposed to do, Jim?

431
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,923
What did you think was gonna happen?

432
00:27:23,928 --> 00:27:25,985
That we were gonna go
camping for a few days

433
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,048
and everything would
just magically get better?

434
00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:31,556
I'm sorry that I wasn't
just ready to cut and run.

435
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,415
Hi.

436
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,142
What are you doing out here?

437
00:27:37,147 --> 00:27:38,844
We gotta go find him.

438
00:27:38,969 --> 00:27:40,368
The boy?

439
00:27:40,373 --> 00:27:43,032
Yeah. I mean, he's
been gone a long time,

440
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:45,126
and we need to ask him why he's back.

441
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:47,264
I'm not supposed to leave.

442
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:49,010
Oh, but you have to

443
00:27:49,052 --> 00:27:50,782
'cause he chose you,

444
00:27:51,204 --> 00:27:53,728
just like he chose me once.

445
00:27:54,171 --> 00:27:55,868
Like a quest?

446
00:27:56,602 --> 00:27:58,060
Yeah.

447
00:27:58,065 --> 00:27:59,493
Okay.

448
00:27:59,705 --> 00:28:01,629
But you can't take that.

449
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:05,483
- Why?
- Hm. No.

450
00:28:05,864 --> 00:28:07,649
They're no good.

451
00:28:10,306 --> 00:28:12,308
Those are for hospitals.

452
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,069
Yeah. That's better.

453
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:17,835
These are for quests.

454
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:20,030
Don't you need one?

455
00:28:20,035 --> 00:28:21,515
Well, I've got this.

456
00:28:22,276 --> 00:28:23,495
Yeah.

457
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,892
Let's go.

458
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,775
You know, if you need to
say shitty things to me

459
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,565
in order to feel better
about what happened, fine.

460
00:28:43,766 --> 00:28:46,053
I'm not having this conversation.

461
00:28:46,305 --> 00:28:49,482
Okay. In that case,
you're getting a sermon.

462
00:28:49,737 --> 00:28:52,296
How 'bout Psalm 23, from the book of

463
00:28:52,301 --> 00:28:54,999
"Cut the Self-Pitying
Bullshit and Be a Leader."

464
00:28:55,741 --> 00:28:59,139
Look, what happened to Lauren
and Meagan wasn't your fault.

465
00:28:59,144 --> 00:29:02,296
Frank putting himself in
this box wasn't your fault.

466
00:29:03,356 --> 00:29:05,905
None of this is really
about them, is it Boyd?

467
00:29:07,063 --> 00:29:09,326
You're gonna want to be very,

468
00:29:09,408 --> 00:29:11,663
very careful about what you say next.

469
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:13,327
Or what?

470
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:16,467
You can't keep punishing yourself, Boyd.

471
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:18,530
She wouldn't have wanted that.

472
00:29:18,535 --> 00:29:21,929
Hey! Hey! You are way
the fuck outta line!

473
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:25,022
You hear me?! Way the fuck outta line!

474
00:29:27,703 --> 00:29:29,705
Before you got here,

475
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,467
I was burying more people in a week

476
00:29:31,472 --> 00:29:33,648
than you've seen die
in the last two years.

477
00:29:33,846 --> 00:29:36,066
But you were the one
who found the talismans.

478
00:29:36,212 --> 00:29:37,936
You created order from chaos.

479
00:29:37,941 --> 00:29:40,030
You made it possible for
people here to live again,

480
00:29:40,035 --> 00:29:41,491
not just survive.

481
00:29:41,496 --> 00:29:43,569
You saved this town, Boyd!

482
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,110
But the price you paid...

483
00:29:47,634 --> 00:29:49,905
I can still see her face
when I close my eyes.

484
00:29:50,213 --> 00:29:51,359
- Look...
- I can't even imagine

485
00:29:51,363 --> 00:29:52,546
what it must be like for you,

486
00:29:52,551 --> 00:29:56,249
and I wish you had the luxury
of grief, but you don't, Boyd.

487
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:57,951
These people need you.

488
00:29:58,925 --> 00:30:01,687
We went three months
without a single death,

489
00:30:01,692 --> 00:30:03,607
and there's been six
in the last three days.

490
00:30:03,962 --> 00:30:08,749
People are scared. Okay?
The edges are starting to fray.

491
00:30:08,754 --> 00:30:11,296
You need to be the one to
tell 'em it's gonna be okay.

492
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:14,640
Look, you want to use
me as a punching bag?

493
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,366
You need a place to put all
your anger, all those regrets?

494
00:30:17,371 --> 00:30:18,765
Fine!

495
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:23,054
But they need you to be strong,
to hold this place together.

496
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:27,468
You need to be the one
to lead these people home.

497
00:30:27,473 --> 00:30:29,214
'Cause if you don't...

498
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:33,151
she died for nothing.

499
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:41,649
And that's where the sermon ends.

500
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,454
Come on. Come on.

501
00:30:56,598 --> 00:30:59,855
It's been so long
since he went away,

502
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,464
I started to think it was just a dream.

503
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:06,542
The first time I saw him was
right before the two cars came.

504
00:31:07,037 --> 00:31:09,894
Not your two cars. The first two cars.

505
00:31:10,298 --> 00:31:11,308
When was that?

506
00:31:11,313 --> 00:31:13,663
Oh, it's been a while.

507
00:31:14,189 --> 00:31:16,452
I wasn't much older
than you when they came.

508
00:31:16,795 --> 00:31:17,795
Really?

509
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,277
Mm-hmm.

510
00:31:19,282 --> 00:31:21,458
You've been here a
pretty long time, huh?

511
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,448
I've been here the longest.

512
00:31:25,445 --> 00:31:29,666
For a long time there was
nobody else here but me.

513
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,324
How did you get here?

514
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:36,595
Mm. We shouldn't talk about that.

515
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:38,698
What happened to your parents?

516
00:31:38,703 --> 00:31:41,112
I just said that we
shouldn't talk about it!

517
00:31:41,421 --> 00:31:42,901
Sorry.

518
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,303
I used to have a little brother.

519
00:31:46,628 --> 00:31:48,847
His name was Thomas.

520
00:31:49,635 --> 00:31:52,027
He died when he was a baby.

521
00:31:53,934 --> 00:31:55,718
Why'd you tell me that?

522
00:31:55,723 --> 00:31:57,120
Because we're friends.

523
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,866
I don't want to know that stuff.

524
00:31:59,063 --> 00:32:00,284
Why not?

525
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:05,310
- Hey.
- What's the matter?

526
00:32:05,315 --> 00:32:06,534
Hey.

527
00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:09,770
Hey.

528
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:11,302
Look.

529
00:32:13,021 --> 00:32:14,370
There he is.

530
00:32:18,451 --> 00:32:20,148
We gotta go, we gotta go.

531
00:32:32,638 --> 00:32:34,028
Tabby, can we just figure this out?

532
00:32:34,032 --> 00:32:35,081
No, no, no, no, no, no.

533
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,706
I can't do that right now.

534
00:32:37,711 --> 00:32:38,910
I really can't. You know what?

535
00:32:38,914 --> 00:32:41,417
I'm... I'm gonna take
Ethan to see Julie. Okay?

536
00:32:41,422 --> 00:32:43,511
We'll talk later. Ethan!

537
00:32:44,801 --> 00:32:46,281
Ethan!

538
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:51,228
Ethan, sweetie, where are you?

539
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:52,747
Ethan!

540
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,833
Ethan!

541
00:33:02,805 --> 00:33:04,111
Oh, my God, Jim!

542
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:06,848
Ethan?

543
00:33:06,853 --> 00:33:08,458
Ethan!

544
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,552
Ethan?

545
00:33:12,144 --> 00:33:13,711
Where did he go?

546
00:33:13,716 --> 00:33:16,415
Look. A farway tree.

547
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:18,947
What is that?

548
00:33:19,913 --> 00:33:21,552
Watch.

549
00:33:53,868 --> 00:33:55,536
What's supposed to happen?

550
00:33:55,549 --> 00:34:00,021
Oh, could be nothing or it could be...

551
00:34:13,606 --> 00:34:15,466
H-how does it do that?

552
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:17,821
I don't know. But guess what?

553
00:34:17,826 --> 00:34:20,302
- What?
- It works for people, too.

554
00:34:20,307 --> 00:34:21,830
Really?

555
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,558
Problem is

556
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:25,230
you never know where you'll end up.

557
00:34:25,235 --> 00:34:29,122
It could be somewhere close,
it could be somewhere far,

558
00:34:29,127 --> 00:34:31,020
or it could be that
you end up stuck inside

559
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:33,661
a mountain somewhere.

560
00:34:34,709 --> 00:34:36,942
They're temperamental that way.

561
00:34:37,996 --> 00:34:39,171
Are there more?

562
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:40,613
Oh, there's a bunch.

563
00:34:40,618 --> 00:34:42,450
I've never seen this one before.

564
00:34:44,264 --> 00:34:46,092
So, now what do we do?

565
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:49,750
No.

566
00:34:52,311 --> 00:34:53,476
No.

567
00:34:53,481 --> 00:34:54,645
No.

568
00:34:55,744 --> 00:34:57,435
What's wrong?

569
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,093
Don't you hear that?!

570
00:35:01,174 --> 00:35:02,583
No.

571
00:35:02,588 --> 00:35:05,481
Come on. We... we gotta go. Come on.

572
00:35:05,486 --> 00:35:06,617
Ethan!

573
00:35:07,654 --> 00:35:09,247
Ethan!

574
00:35:09,746 --> 00:35:11,357
Ethan!

575
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:22,786
Oh, Jim.

576
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:25,177
Jim?

577
00:35:30,531 --> 00:35:31,811
What's happening?

578
00:35:36,254 --> 00:35:38,841
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Ethan!
- Mom! Dad!

579
00:35:38,846 --> 00:35:40,053
Ethan, come, come, come!

580
00:35:40,057 --> 00:35:42,997
Honey, come on, come on! Who is the guy?

581
00:35:43,974 --> 00:35:45,810
Why are you with him? Are you okay?

582
00:35:45,815 --> 00:35:48,052
Let me see you. Oh my God. Oh my God.

583
00:35:48,057 --> 00:35:49,057
I warned you.

584
00:35:49,062 --> 00:35:50,502
How's your leg? It's okay?

585
00:35:50,507 --> 00:35:52,411
- I warned you.
- Please.

586
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,075
I fucking warned you.

587
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,344
I'm not a bad person.
I would never hurt anyone.

588
00:35:58,767 --> 00:36:00,986
Dad, leave him alone!

589
00:36:01,124 --> 00:36:02,821
Jim! Jim, he has a gun.

590
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:03,969
Sorry.

591
00:36:03,974 --> 00:36:07,013
Jim, let's go! Let's go.

592
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,341
Jim.

593
00:36:13,207 --> 00:36:16,466
Jim, let's go! He has a gun.

594
00:36:19,122 --> 00:36:20,732
Don't ever leave the house.

595
00:36:20,737 --> 00:36:22,739
Okay? Don't ever leave the house.

596
00:38:38,467 --> 00:38:40,121
Sheriff?

597
00:38:40,339 --> 00:38:42,733
Not Sheriff. Just Boyd.

598
00:38:43,753 --> 00:38:45,189
'Sup?

599
00:38:45,194 --> 00:38:47,500
Look, I don't mean to be a...

600
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,147
I-I got a problem.

601
00:38:51,152 --> 00:38:54,024
This-this guy Victor,
up at Colony House?

602
00:38:54,587 --> 00:38:57,579
Right. Look, Victor is
one of Donna's people.

603
00:38:57,853 --> 00:38:59,891
The way it works here,
with the townspeople

604
00:38:59,896 --> 00:39:00,896
and Colony House...

605
00:39:00,901 --> 00:39:03,174
No, I'm... I'm not talking about
the way it works around here.

606
00:39:03,178 --> 00:39:07,071
I'm talking about this guy.
He's... he's taken my kid

607
00:39:07,076 --> 00:39:10,340
to the woods, he's
drawn pictures for him...

608
00:39:14,494 --> 00:39:17,360
Right. Sorry about that.

609
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,673
I'll have a talk with Donna.

610
00:39:19,678 --> 00:39:21,720
We'll make sure it doesn't happen again.

611
00:39:23,676 --> 00:39:26,140
Do you know he carries
a gun in his lunchbox?

612
00:39:26,145 --> 00:39:27,579
Jesus.

613
00:39:27,672 --> 00:39:29,239
You may wanna mention that to her.

614
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:30,423
Yeah.

615
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,946
Anyway, I'll let you... get back to it.

616
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:39,853
Hey, Jim. Wait.

617
00:39:40,868 --> 00:39:44,314
Listen, uh, look,

618
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:46,251
things around here have been a little...

619
00:39:46,256 --> 00:39:49,587
Been a lot crazy ever
since your family got here.

620
00:39:49,592 --> 00:39:53,454
We have not had a chance
to get to know each other.

621
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,821
Let's change that.

622
00:39:56,364 --> 00:39:58,501
What are you guys doing for dinner?

623
00:39:59,955 --> 00:40:01,892
Hey. Watch out.

624
00:40:01,897 --> 00:40:03,400
- I can't...
- Okay, this way.

625
00:40:03,404 --> 00:40:04,845
Okay, my God.

626
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:05,894
I'm so scared right now.

627
00:40:05,899 --> 00:40:07,553
Just a couple more steps.

628
00:40:07,558 --> 00:40:09,071
Careful, careful.

629
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:10,295
Can I please see?

630
00:40:10,316 --> 00:40:11,454
Just a second.

631
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:12,939
Okay.

632
00:40:13,063 --> 00:40:16,327
Okay. Now. Oh my God.

633
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:18,251
Now, before I take my hands off,

634
00:40:18,256 --> 00:40:19,953
there's something I
want you to know, okay?

635
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:21,394
Okay.

636
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:26,446
Okay. Julie, there are
no mistakes, just choices,

637
00:40:26,451 --> 00:40:28,627
and you chose what was right for you,

638
00:40:28,632 --> 00:40:31,790
and that matters a lot.

639
00:40:32,511 --> 00:40:34,208
Okay.

640
00:40:34,213 --> 00:40:35,475
Okay.

641
00:40:36,996 --> 00:40:38,486
Madam Julie,

642
00:40:38,498 --> 00:40:41,480
behold your very new
sleeping arrangements,

643
00:40:41,485 --> 00:40:44,526
equipped with a cozy blanket
and your very own pillow.

644
00:40:44,531 --> 00:40:46,995
- Oh my...
- Naming rights are optional.

645
00:40:47,337 --> 00:40:48,861
But wait! There's more!

646
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:50,120
Ah, there is more.

647
00:40:50,488 --> 00:40:52,400
Let's see.

648
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,793
Curtains for privacy!

649
00:40:54,798 --> 00:40:55,862
Oh my...

650
00:40:56,439 --> 00:40:58,081
It's all yours.

651
00:40:58,086 --> 00:40:59,753
Thank you.

652
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,410
Come on.

653
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:03,764
- Thank you.
- Go.

654
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:05,589
Well, come on, try it out!

655
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:07,328
Oh my gosh!

656
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:09,639
- It's good, huh?
- I love it!

657
00:41:10,265 --> 00:41:13,138
Seriously, thank you so much.

658
00:41:13,143 --> 00:41:16,414
You don't need to thank
us. You belong here.

659
00:41:16,512 --> 00:41:17,818
Yeah, you do.

660
00:41:18,831 --> 00:41:20,058
And...

661
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,020
so does this.

662
00:41:29,161 --> 00:41:30,722
Oh, honey...

663
00:42:12,813 --> 00:42:14,090
Hamburger's good?

664
00:42:14,095 --> 00:42:15,810
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

665
00:42:16,646 --> 00:42:18,568
And Julie? How is, uh...

666
00:42:18,573 --> 00:42:19,888
How is she?

667
00:42:20,129 --> 00:42:23,524
Um, yeah, yeah, she's... she's okay.

668
00:42:23,703 --> 00:42:25,583
Sure Ellis will take care of her.

669
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,435
Um, I've been meaning to say thank you

670
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,151
for what you did the other night.

671
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:32,500
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

672
00:42:32,505 --> 00:42:34,068
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

673
00:42:34,072 --> 00:42:37,779
My pleasure. You know, the
people in this town, we are...

674
00:42:37,784 --> 00:42:40,221
you know, we take care of each other.

675
00:42:40,437 --> 00:42:42,497
It's... It's like a family.

676
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:44,888
And, uh, given the circumstances,

677
00:42:45,992 --> 00:42:47,428
you guys are doing fine.

678
00:42:47,433 --> 00:42:49,318
- Yeah.
- Okay, here we go.

679
00:42:49,323 --> 00:42:51,586
Special delivery for our newcomers.

680
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:52,940
Thank you.

681
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:54,464
We're VIPs.

682
00:42:54,469 --> 00:42:57,185
Mm-hmm. I've never been a VIP before.

683
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:58,713
So fancy!

684
00:42:58,718 --> 00:43:01,224
Do you wanna help me bring
over the rest of the food?

685
00:43:01,229 --> 00:43:02,544
Yeah!

686
00:43:06,528 --> 00:43:08,466
Oh, you're walking better.

687
00:43:12,627 --> 00:43:14,542
Yeah...

688
00:43:14,774 --> 00:43:17,912
They... They do that
sometimes. It's just, uh...

689
00:43:19,698 --> 00:43:21,326
Sheriff, can I, um...

690
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:23,584
Hey, would you guys
excuse me for a second?

691
00:43:23,588 --> 00:43:26,310
I just need to have
a word with my deputy.

692
00:43:28,162 --> 00:43:30,755
? Crown and anchor me ?

693
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:36,294
? Or let me sail away ?

694
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:39,872
That summer in Texas.

695
00:43:41,556 --> 00:43:44,763
? There is a song for you ?

696
00:43:44,768 --> 00:43:47,161
? Ink on a pin ?

697
00:43:47,534 --> 00:43:48,752
I'm sorry.

698
00:43:49,142 --> 00:43:51,100
? Underneath the skin ?

699
00:43:51,105 --> 00:43:54,625
I'm sorry if I make
you feel like you're...

700
00:43:56,711 --> 00:43:59,099
I just don't know what I'm doing

701
00:44:00,206 --> 00:44:02,638
and I don't know how to do that.

702
00:44:04,235 --> 00:44:08,490
But I-I never, ever
meant to make you feel...

703
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:13,036
I just feel so...

704
00:44:15,329 --> 00:44:16,591
broken.

705
00:44:18,461 --> 00:44:21,701
- And I, uh...
- Hey. No, no, no. Hey.

706
00:44:25,802 --> 00:44:27,505
We're gonna figure it out.

707
00:44:28,564 --> 00:44:30,404
We're gonna figure it out together.

708
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:33,856
Don't worry.

709
00:44:33,861 --> 00:44:35,841
? Hell's the hippest way to go ?

710
00:44:35,846 --> 00:44:38,974
? Well, I don't think so ?

711
00:44:38,979 --> 00:44:40,193
Whatcha got there?

712
00:44:40,198 --> 00:44:41,634
Sweet potatoes.

713
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:42,685
Ooh!

714
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:45,235
Sweet potatoes! Let's try it.

715
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,851
Nice family.

716
00:44:46,856 --> 00:44:48,364
Now, there you go.

717
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:51,029
Come on. It's really good. Try one.

718
00:44:51,264 --> 00:44:52,779
Do you think they're good?

719
00:45:10,536 --> 00:45:14,537

720
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:40,733
Sara!

721
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,740
Hey. Hey, hey!

722
00:45:42,934 --> 00:45:44,100
Oh! Oh, no, no, no. Okay, here!

723
00:45:44,104 --> 00:45:47,552
Grab her... grab her arm,
grab her arm! Hold on, hold on!

724
00:45:57,885 --> 00:46:01,040
Come on! Hold on. Hold on, baby girl.

725
00:46:01,254 --> 00:46:02,404
Okay, Sara.

726
00:46:05,284 --> 00:46:06,589
Victor!

727
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:10,060
Victor!

728
00:46:10,836 --> 00:46:13,365
What the hell are you doing?
You're freaking people out!

729
00:46:14,732 --> 00:46:18,005
I was just trying to get
a head start this time.
