Previously on From...

2
00:00:19,312 --> 00:00:21,270
What's wrong with her?!

3
00:00:21,296 --> 00:00:23,523
- What happened to you?
- What do you mean?

4
00:00:23,549 --> 00:00:26,133
Since you fell asleep and
your eyes got all white,

5
00:00:26,498 --> 00:00:28,008
you've been different.

6
00:00:29,516 --> 00:00:30,976
Do you feel that?

7
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:34,187
- We should go.
- You feel it.

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,517
You do.

9
00:00:35,664 --> 00:00:37,149
What the hell's going on?

10
00:00:37,174 --> 00:00:39,025
It was my idea. She
needed to come out here.

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,069
Mom saw this place when she was little.

12
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:43,947
There might be a part of
you that wants so badly

13
00:00:43,972 --> 00:00:45,625
for all of this to make sense.

14
00:00:45,651 --> 00:00:48,154
This wasn't just a
random nightmare, Jim.

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,680
This was a dream I had for months.

16
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:52,872
Miranda said she was chosen.

17
00:00:52,898 --> 00:00:55,646
If you were destined
to come to this place,

18
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:58,899
then one way or another, you were always
gonna come to that tree in the road.

19
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,031
He knows things.

20
00:01:03,242 --> 00:01:07,234
I heard him tell Christopher a
story about this place once.

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,096
We'll make him tell it again.

22
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:12,084
Can I go in your basement?

23
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,310
I need him to tell me a secret.

24
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,273
Help me, Elgin.

25
00:01:18,298 --> 00:01:20,396
I can save all of you.

26
00:01:30,076 --> 00:01:31,635
Is this really where it happens?

27
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:34,834
Whatever is inside me,
it's getting stronger.

28
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:37,292
The cravings they're
getting stronger.

29
00:01:37,317 --> 00:01:39,794
- I'm angry all the time.
- It's okay.

30
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:41,838
Fatima, it's gonna be okay.

31
00:01:41,863 --> 00:01:43,201
I said go!

32
00:01:44,742 --> 00:01:46,068
Help!

33
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:49,599
What have I done? What have I done?

34
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:55,623
Come on.

35
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:58,138
Have a seat.

36
00:02:05,552 --> 00:02:08,073
Have a seat. Tell me what happened.

37
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,558
We were in the greenhouse.

38
00:02:10,584 --> 00:02:11,779
I was...

39
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,537
And I didn't wanna eat those
rotting things anymore.

40
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:20,459
Tillie came in, and she
was trying to help me,

41
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,105
and I felt this wave
of anger come over me,

42
00:02:25,131 --> 00:02:26,823
like this rage.

43
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:30,904
It was like this thing inside me.
It was...

44
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:34,334
It was like I was there, but I wasn't.

45
00:02:34,903 --> 00:02:39,748
And I felt my hand reach for the shears.

46
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:42,498
And I couldn't stop.

47
00:02:43,302 --> 00:02:45,890
I didn't wanna do it.
There was nothing I could do.

48
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,451
Here's what we're gonna do.

49
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,756
You're gonna stay out here tonight.

50
00:02:50,343 --> 00:02:51,818
And come morning,

51
00:02:52,058 --> 00:02:54,654
Ellis and I are gonna
figure out the best way...

52
00:02:56,029 --> 00:02:58,999
We're gonna figure out
how we move forward.

53
00:02:59,024 --> 00:03:00,500
There's no way forward.

54
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:02,161
Hey. Look at me.

55
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:05,309
You are my family.

56
00:03:05,857 --> 00:03:07,841
And what happened back there,

57
00:03:08,357 --> 00:03:10,381
we are gonna find a way to deal with it.

58
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:11,512
Okay?

59
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,101
Fatima.

60
00:03:13,731 --> 00:03:14,873
Okay?

61
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,724
Okay.

62
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:25,350
If you need to eat...

63
00:03:25,508 --> 00:03:27,686
No, no, no, no. Please.

64
00:03:27,712 --> 00:03:29,027
- Please take that away.
- Look,

65
00:03:29,061 --> 00:03:30,154
- whatever is happening to you...
- Take it away.

66
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,730
I don't want it to get any worse.

67
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:33,991
So, you need to eat, you eat.

68
00:03:34,017 --> 00:03:35,201
What about Tillie?

69
00:03:35,226 --> 00:03:37,529
We just... I left her there.

70
00:03:37,694 --> 00:03:39,654
- I left her there.
- Okay.

71
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,350
- My God, I left her there.
- Listen to me, listen.

72
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:44,475
We're gonna have to
let someone find her.

73
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,005
Oh, my God.

74
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,175
No. No, no, no. I know. Hey.
Look at me, look at me.

75
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,878
Look, I need you to be
strong right now, okay?

76
00:03:52,904 --> 00:03:57,083
I need you to be... Ellis needs
you to be strong. Please.

77
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,311
That's right.

78
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:03,248
Okay.

79
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,443
Now it's getting dark.

80
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,537
This door stays closed, no matter what.

81
00:04:09,997 --> 00:04:11,154
Right.

82
00:04:12,807 --> 00:04:14,518
We're gonna be okay.

83

www.subtitulamos.tv

84
00:06:28,123 --> 00:06:30,356
We're coming in two minutes!

85
00:06:36,324 --> 00:06:37,502
Hey...

86
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,072
I'll catch up with you guys later.

87
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,268
Hey, Ethan, Ethan...

88
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:40,397
Hello?

89
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,007
Okay.

90
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:51,040
Hello?!

91
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:53,335
Hey. Sorry.

92
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:55,420
Who the fuck are you?

93
00:07:55,445 --> 00:07:58,515
Sorry, I'm... Henry Kavanaugh.

94
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:01,361
You probably know my son.

95
00:08:01,387 --> 00:08:02,632
Victor.

96
00:08:05,405 --> 00:08:06,464
Right.

97
00:08:06,991 --> 00:08:09,281
- Nice to meet you.
- Same.

98
00:08:15,438 --> 00:08:18,359
It's quite the set-up you've got.

99
00:08:18,828 --> 00:08:20,570
You making any progress?

100
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:22,867
No, not really.

101
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:27,813
I hope you don't mind if I
grab a little pick-me-up.

102
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:32,024
Help yourself.

103
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:33,439
Cheers.

104
00:09:01,193 --> 00:09:02,426
We need help!

105
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:04,130
Help! I need help!

106
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:07,903
- Somebody get Donna!
- What is it?!

107
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:11,286
It's Tillie!

108
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:12,965
Shit.

109
00:09:36,855 --> 00:09:38,247
I'm going home.

110
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:39,984
Have you seen Kristi or Marielle?

111
00:09:40,016 --> 00:09:41,662
- No.
- Can you just tell them

112
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:43,152
I said thank you for
letting me stay the night?

113
00:09:43,177 --> 00:09:44,617
I don't get a thank you?

114
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:47,466
Thank you, Randall, for
letting me stay at the place

115
00:09:47,492 --> 00:09:49,328
that Marielle and Kristi
are letting you stay at.

116
00:09:49,354 --> 00:09:50,649
You're welcome.

117
00:09:55,453 --> 00:09:57,219
We should go back.

118
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:01,289
To that place, whatever
it is, we should...

119
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:03,235
we should go back and check it out.

120
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:06,359
What?

121
00:10:06,385 --> 00:10:07,719
Well, typically,

122
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:11,115
when a place makes the hair on
the back of my neck stand up,

123
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:12,852
it's enough for me to stay away.

124
00:10:13,227 --> 00:10:16,019
Yeah, but we both felt it.

125
00:10:16,044 --> 00:10:17,959
Right? What if it can

126
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,758
I don't know, help with
whatever's happening...

127
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:21,820
And what if it makes it worse?

128
00:10:25,994 --> 00:10:27,226
Look...

129
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,711
There is nothing here

130
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,672
that wants to help us.

131
00:10:34,378 --> 00:10:35,680
Okay? Nothing.

132
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:38,024
So, stay the fuck away from that place.

133
00:10:39,007 --> 00:10:40,133
Right?

134
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:52,565
Remember what I said. Anybody asks,

135
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:55,266
you and Fatima were with
me last night. Okay?

136
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:57,651
What if we just tell them the truth

137
00:10:57,677 --> 00:10:59,103
and explain what happened?

138
00:10:59,128 --> 00:11:01,064
- Ellis...
- That it wasn't her fault.

139
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:02,732
I know. I know.

140
00:11:02,757 --> 00:11:04,920
Maybe some of those people
will understand that.

141
00:11:05,093 --> 00:11:07,987
There's no version of us
explaining this away.

142
00:11:08,763 --> 00:11:10,565
Look, they're gonna put her in the Box.

143
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:12,437
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Look at me.

144
00:11:12,517 --> 00:11:14,943
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Get yourself together.

145
00:11:15,045 --> 00:11:18,190
Go in there, get up to your room,

146
00:11:18,216 --> 00:11:19,927
put some things in a bag.

147
00:11:20,404 --> 00:11:22,857
Don't pack too much, just enough for her

148
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:25,128
to spend a couple days
out there at the shack.

149
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:27,459
- And what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna...

150
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:30,237
- Boyd!
- buy us some time. Hey!

151
00:11:32,948 --> 00:11:35,300
Hey... We found something.

152
00:11:47,553 --> 00:11:49,306
Anyone see anything?

153
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:52,361
Not that we've...

154
00:11:52,972 --> 00:11:54,448
Not that we've heard so far.

155
00:11:54,474 --> 00:11:56,360
Any idea when this happened?

156
00:11:57,478 --> 00:11:59,956
Could've been this morning.
It could've been last night.

157
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:02,083
There's not a whole lot
of people coming in,

158
00:12:02,108 --> 00:12:04,056
with the snow and everything.

159
00:12:04,694 --> 00:12:06,767
Those things that come out at night,

160
00:12:07,484 --> 00:12:09,448
I'm guessing they don't
use gardening shears?

161
00:12:09,474 --> 00:12:10,720
No.

162
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:14,712
We should talk to everyone in the house.

163
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:16,150
Boyd?

164
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:22,806
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Start talking to people.

165
00:12:23,696 --> 00:12:25,749
I'll take Ellis out to walk the road.

166
00:12:25,775 --> 00:12:27,525
- Walk the road?
- This could've been done

167
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:29,350
by people we know or people we don't.

168
00:12:29,376 --> 00:12:30,821
We need to rule out the possibility

169
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,896
we had any new arrivals yesterday

170
00:12:32,922 --> 00:12:34,376
that we don't know about.

171
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:35,783
- All right?
- Yeah.

172
00:12:35,808 --> 00:12:37,400
Yeah. Hey.

173
00:12:38,853 --> 00:12:41,040
I know, you're not my deputy, but...

174
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:42,464
Yeah, no, I got it.

175
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:44,759
We'll get the interviews started.

176
00:12:44,785 --> 00:12:45,875
Yeah.

177
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:52,079
Hey, Sheriff.

178
00:12:53,047 --> 00:12:54,228
We good?

179
00:12:54,777 --> 00:12:56,564
Let's find out who did this.

180
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:10,760
Hey, you okay?

181
00:13:11,052 --> 00:13:13,353
Hell, we're gonna have to talk to Sara.

182
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:16,767
- It wasn't her.
- You don't know that.

183
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:18,994
And I am not the only person

184
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:21,759
who's gonna be asking about her.

185
00:13:25,984 --> 00:13:27,793
If you don't think she did it, fine.

186
00:13:27,818 --> 00:13:29,462
Then, we'll just have to...

187
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:31,049
go talk to her and make sure.

188
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:32,713
- Listen...
- No, no, no, you listen.

189
00:13:32,739 --> 00:13:35,963
Hiding every night from those
things, that's one thing.

190
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,773
But this? This is something

191
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:41,306
that people are gonna have
to blame someone for.

192
00:13:41,556 --> 00:13:43,184
And if we don't figure out who,

193
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:45,963
then it's gonna be Sara,
whether she did it or not.

194
00:13:47,508 --> 00:13:48,728
Okay.

195
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:52,744
You get things straightened out
here, then meet me at the station,

196
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,009
and we will talk to her together.

197
00:14:17,252 --> 00:14:18,686
"Hello, Victor.

198
00:14:18,712 --> 00:14:20,481
Do you want to play today?

199
00:14:20,507 --> 00:14:22,097
- I can tell you a secret."
- No, no, no.

200
00:14:22,123 --> 00:14:24,115
Not like that! I told you!

201
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:25,550
It doesn't sound like that, Sara!

202
00:14:25,576 --> 00:14:27,091
I'm doing the best that I can!

203
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:30,998
I'm trying everything that I know!
I don't know what you want, Victor!

204
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:34,923
No! No!

205
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:36,540
He doesn't... you need...

206
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:38,239
he needs to talk, and
you're not doing it right!

207
00:14:38,264 --> 00:14:41,325
- I'm doing the best that I can!
- No, you're not doing it good enough!

208
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:43,235
No, you're not good enough.

209
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:44,957
- You're not good enough.
- Victor! Hey!

210
00:14:44,983 --> 00:14:46,168
You're not good enough.

211
00:14:46,194 --> 00:14:47,805
- You're not good enough. You're not
good enough. - Hey, don't! Stop! Stop!

212
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:49,472
- You're not good enough.
- Stop! Stop!

213
00:14:54,082 --> 00:14:57,768
Look, I know you want all
this to mean something,

214
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,136
and this place has you
convinced that you need

215
00:15:00,161 --> 00:15:01,816
to save these children.

216
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:06,004
It's got you trying to fix
something that we can never...

217
00:15:12,304 --> 00:15:14,394
Do you know why the
phone is off the wall?

218
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:19,793
Because it rang the other day,

219
00:15:19,957 --> 00:15:23,087
and the voice on the other end
said his name was Thomas.

220
00:15:28,502 --> 00:15:29,707
What?

221
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:40,903
Something here knows things about us,

222
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,551
and it knows which buttons to push.

223
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:53,215
I'm sorry.

224
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:55,481
I know I shouldn't be here, but...

225
00:15:55,738 --> 00:15:59,008
Victor is in my basement, and
he's in really bad shape.

226
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,473
He said he only wants to talk to you.

227
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:06,465
I wouldn't have come if
it wasn't important.

228
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,082
Just wait there. I'll get my coat.

229
00:16:10,468 --> 00:16:11,887
I have to go.

230
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:15,426
Hello?

231
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:26,095
Hey.

232
00:16:27,197 --> 00:16:29,084
If you're looking for drugs,
you're in the wrong spot.

233
00:16:29,111 --> 00:16:30,884
Oh, no, no.

234
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:34,088
I was... just looking for a Band-Aid.

235
00:16:34,838 --> 00:16:36,226
I cut my foot.

236
00:16:37,494 --> 00:16:39,151
You better not let Kristi or Marielle

237
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:40,986
find you rooting through their shit.

238
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:43,587
You hear about Tillie?

239
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:46,296
Yeah.

240
00:16:47,477 --> 00:16:48,924
It's fucked up.

241
00:16:53,286 --> 00:16:54,333
Hey.

242
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:56,791
I'm sorry I was so hard on you

243
00:16:56,817 --> 00:16:58,295
on the bus that day.

244
00:16:58,872 --> 00:17:00,181
I guess you were right.

245
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,716
We should've turned around.

246
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:06,966
Sorry I threw up all over your shirt.

247
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,363
Yeah.

248
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,524
_

249
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,377
Victor?

250
00:17:39,245 --> 00:17:40,579
You're here.

251
00:17:40,605 --> 00:17:42,539
- Hi, Victor. Hi.
- Good. Come.

252
00:17:42,565 --> 00:17:43,706
Hey.

253
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,475
You sit...

254
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:49,152
- Come sit here.
- Okay.

255
00:17:49,178 --> 00:17:50,683
There. Take this.

256
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:51,827
Okay.

257
00:17:51,998 --> 00:17:53,558
Victor, what are we...

258
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:55,889
You were there. You were there
when I remembered Eloise,

259
00:17:55,915 --> 00:17:58,109
so you're the one that
can make him talk.

260
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:00,577
Okay, Victor, I'm so sorry.

261
00:18:00,603 --> 00:18:02,121
I don't know... I don't understand.

262
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,418
He needs to tell me. You
need to make him tell me.

263
00:18:04,444 --> 00:18:05,905
Tell you what, Victor?

264
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,011
The secrets that he told Christopher

265
00:18:08,037 --> 00:18:09,655
'cause he can help us.

266
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:11,908
I'm sorry, honey. He's just a doll.

267
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:14,222
No. No, no, you have to be the one.

268
00:18:14,248 --> 00:18:16,160
- You have to be the one!
- Okay, okay!

269
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:17,666
You have to be the one!

270
00:18:17,691 --> 00:18:19,835
- Victor! Hey! Hey!
- You have to be the one!

271
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,584
- You have to be the one!
- Hey! Victor, stop it!

272
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,108
- Stop it. Don't do that.
- You have to be the one.

273
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:25,507
Calm down. Don't do
that, Victor, please.

274
00:18:26,092 --> 00:18:28,905
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.

275
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:32,160
Look at me, Victor. It's okay.
You're okay.

276
00:18:32,186 --> 00:18:33,599
- You're okay.
- Okay.

277
00:18:33,624 --> 00:18:34,644
- It's okay.
- Yeah.

278
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,287
Do you want to draw a picture?

279
00:18:36,663 --> 00:18:37,779
No.

280
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:40,623
No, it doesn't work like that.

281
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:43,082
See, the pictures always remembered

282
00:18:43,108 --> 00:18:44,860
so that I didn't have to.

283
00:18:45,178 --> 00:18:47,912
But I never drew one,

284
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:51,113
so now it's gone, and I can't...

285
00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:53,074
- I can't remember.
- No.

286
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,203
No, okay, okay. First of all, sit down.

287
00:18:55,229 --> 00:18:57,836
It's okay. You're okay. You're okay.

288
00:18:57,862 --> 00:18:59,280
Sit down, okay?

289
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,834
It's okay, Victor. Just sit down.

290
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:14,098
It's okay, Victor.

291
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,793
Nothing is gone. Nothing's gone.

292
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:18,137
It's okay.

293
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:22,189
Tell me about... tell me about the doll.

294
00:19:22,214 --> 00:19:24,270
His name is Jasper.

295
00:19:24,378 --> 00:19:28,189
Jasper? Okay. Tell me about Jasper.

296
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:32,129
I heard him once telling Christopher
things that we need to know.

297
00:19:33,176 --> 00:19:34,799
But I don't remember.

298
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:37,520
Hey, it's okay. Victor, look at me.

299
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:39,111
- But...
- Look at me.

300
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,041
We'll remember together,

301
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:42,957
just like last time.

302
00:19:43,277 --> 00:19:45,489
- Okay. Okay.
- We can do this together, okay?

303
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:46,762
- Okay.
- Yeah.

304
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:52,473
Hello?

305
00:19:52,786 --> 00:19:53,937
Anyone home?

306
00:19:53,963 --> 00:19:55,098
Hey.

307
00:19:56,793 --> 00:19:59,082
How were things at the settlement?

308
00:20:00,711 --> 00:20:01,895
Not great.

309
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,524
Listen, your brother's upstairs.

310
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:07,004
Would you mind hanging
with him for a bit?

311
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,530
- Where are you going?
- Something I gotta take care of.

312
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:12,184
- Okay?
- But...

313
00:20:21,636 --> 00:20:22,797
Ethan?

314
00:20:30,267 --> 00:20:31,615
You doing okay?

315
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:34,466
- I'm fine.
- 'Cause I thought,

316
00:20:34,492 --> 00:20:38,091
maybe you might wanna go
see something really cool.

317
00:20:43,388 --> 00:20:46,831
My wife had visions of this place.

318
00:20:48,536 --> 00:20:50,526
Yeah, I've heard.

319
00:20:51,402 --> 00:20:53,245
I thought she was crazy.

320
00:20:54,522 --> 00:20:56,542
I should've listened to her.

321
00:20:56,568 --> 00:20:57,768
Well...

322
00:20:58,847 --> 00:21:01,292
shoulda, woulda, coulda, right?

323
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,188
What exactly makes you think

324
00:21:04,214 --> 00:21:06,448
you're gonna be the one
to figure this out?

325
00:21:06,568 --> 00:21:09,995
I imagine a lot of pretty
smart people have tried.

326
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:12,886
I'm smarter.

327
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:14,933
Please, come on in.

328
00:21:15,572 --> 00:21:17,362
Make yourself at home.

329
00:21:18,638 --> 00:21:19,987
It's done.

330
00:21:21,262 --> 00:21:22,580
Right now.

331
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:24,767
Do you understand me?

332
00:21:25,065 --> 00:21:26,831
What are we talking about?

333
00:21:26,922 --> 00:21:30,317
Who the fuck do you think you
are dragging my wife and kid

334
00:21:30,342 --> 00:21:32,698
out into the middle of the woods?

335
00:21:33,924 --> 00:21:35,421
Okay, first of all,

336
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:38,527
- I didn't drag anybody anywhere...
- I only wanna say this once.

337
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:41,714
Tabitha is not in a
good place right now.

338
00:21:41,745 --> 00:21:44,998
She doesn't need you filling
her head with ideas

339
00:21:45,023 --> 00:21:46,523
about how somehow,

340
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:49,203
she's this chosen savior,
responsible for getting

341
00:21:49,229 --> 00:21:51,971
- everybody home...
- You get your fucking hands off me!

342
00:21:52,823 --> 00:21:55,752
Filling her head with ideas?
What is she, nine?

343
00:21:56,377 --> 00:22:00,448
Jim, she... she came here!
She came here, okay?

344
00:22:00,474 --> 00:22:03,581
She saw the drawings, she
recognized the, s...

345
00:22:03,877 --> 00:22:05,765
You know what? I don't need
to explain this to you.

346
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,198
All right, then, let me
explain this to you.

347
00:22:08,724 --> 00:22:13,258
You are a lonely, selfish,
narcissistic asshole,

348
00:22:13,284 --> 00:22:16,234
who doesn't give a shit
about anything but yourself

349
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,698
and your own goddamn ego.

350
00:22:17,723 --> 00:22:20,075
If you wanna kill yourself
trying to figure this thing out,

351
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,285
be my guest.

352
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,370
But I have a family to look out for.

353
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:24,797
I have people

354
00:22:24,823 --> 00:22:26,867
who mean more to me than
you will ever understand.

355
00:22:26,893 --> 00:22:29,084
Jim, I'm getting a little tired

356
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:31,726
of this sanctimonious
blue-collar bullshit.

357
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:34,338
You wanna talk about your family?
Let's talk about your family.

358
00:22:34,364 --> 00:22:36,038
Of the two of us,

359
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,979
I am the only one doing a
goddamn thing to help them.

360
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:42,406
Look at this! You see this? This.

361
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,500
- This helps people!
- No!

362
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:46,367
You know what this does?!

363
00:22:46,393 --> 00:22:49,813
This shows people how
you are the smartest

364
00:22:49,838 --> 00:22:52,659
- fucking prick in the room!
- So what?!

365
00:22:52,883 --> 00:22:54,885
If it gets us home,

366
00:22:55,227 --> 00:22:57,651
who gives a shit?!

367
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:01,930
And I'm not gonna do this. I'm sorry.
I'm not gonna do this.

368
00:23:01,956 --> 00:23:03,479
I'm not gonna waste any more of my time.

369
00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:06,065
Listen, if you wanna keep
your kids under lock and key,

370
00:23:06,091 --> 00:23:08,664
more power to you. Tabitha's a grown-up.

371
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,510
You got a problem with what
she's doing, talk to her.

372
00:23:11,777 --> 00:23:13,212
Sorry. We're not done here!

373
00:23:13,237 --> 00:23:15,096
Yeah, we fucking are, Jim!

374
00:23:18,861 --> 00:23:21,198
That was certainly productive.

375
00:23:24,914 --> 00:23:26,041
Fatima?

376
00:23:36,698 --> 00:23:38,175
Come here.

377
00:23:40,163 --> 00:23:41,933
We're gonna get this through this, okay?

378
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,537
Ellis, I need you and your
dad to stop saying that.

379
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:48,862
I killed someone.

380
00:23:48,888 --> 00:23:49,907
How, I mean...

381
00:23:49,933 --> 00:23:52,229
- Help me.
- No, listen to me. Listen to me.

382
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:55,729
Whatever this is, it's you and I.

383
00:23:56,178 --> 00:23:57,571
We are in this together.

384
00:23:57,597 --> 00:23:59,995
I don't care if we need to take that
talisman and go live in the woods.

385
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,779
No. You don't understand.

386
00:24:01,805 --> 00:24:04,589
Ellis, whatever is inside me,

387
00:24:04,663 --> 00:24:07,015
whatever made me... it's still there.

388
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,059
- No. Babe, hey.
- It's still there.

389
00:24:09,084 --> 00:24:10,761
What if it happens again?

390
00:24:10,787 --> 00:24:12,646
What if I... what if I...
what if I do something...

391
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:15,636
You won't. You won't.
Look at me. Look at me.

392
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,167
You won't.

393
00:24:17,651 --> 00:24:19,597
Because you are stronger than this.

394
00:24:19,623 --> 00:24:22,659
Whatever this is, we are
stronger than this.

395
00:24:24,435 --> 00:24:25,535
Okay?

396
00:24:25,717 --> 00:24:26,987
Fatima?

397
00:24:29,647 --> 00:24:30,776
Okay.

398
00:24:37,374 --> 00:24:39,144
I brought you some things.

399
00:24:40,203 --> 00:24:41,370
Some...

400
00:24:42,242 --> 00:24:44,323
Some clothes if you wanna change.

401
00:24:48,786 --> 00:24:50,269
Lucky handkerchief.

402
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,782
Remember?

403
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:54,730
I love you.

404
00:24:54,755 --> 00:24:56,368
I love you, too.

405
00:24:59,354 --> 00:25:00,524
Okay.

406
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,172
I'll be back soon.

407
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,727
- Okay.
- Okay.

408
00:25:05,808 --> 00:25:07,040
Soon.

409
00:27:16,822 --> 00:27:21,068
You mind if I give you
some unsolicited advice?

410
00:27:21,227 --> 00:27:22,912
I don't see why not.

411
00:27:24,262 --> 00:27:26,529
Maybe, sometimes,

412
00:27:26,966 --> 00:27:28,990
when you're with your wife...

413
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:33,334
you should shut the fuck up and listen.

414
00:27:36,356 --> 00:27:37,701
Excuse me?

415
00:27:39,212 --> 00:27:41,730
Jim, I look at you right now.

416
00:27:41,755 --> 00:27:45,818
All I see is me standing
there 40 years ago.

417
00:27:46,551 --> 00:27:50,167
I was so sure I could "fix" her.

418
00:27:50,677 --> 00:27:54,271
It never occurred to
me she wasn't broken.

419
00:27:56,184 --> 00:28:01,521
That... arrogant fella
who stormed outta here?

420
00:28:02,684 --> 00:28:04,769
He was right about one thing.

421
00:28:04,795 --> 00:28:06,313
What you're doing,

422
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:08,818
how tight you're holding
on to everything...

423
00:28:10,204 --> 00:28:14,560
You may tell yourself you're
doing it for your family.

424
00:28:15,657 --> 00:28:19,560
But you're doing it
because you're scared,

425
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,326
and you're doing it for yourself.

426
00:28:24,545 --> 00:28:28,779
I'm probably the only guy in this
whole place who can tell you that

427
00:28:29,115 --> 00:28:32,515
and say...
it's true.

428
00:28:33,748 --> 00:28:35,264
It's true.

429
00:28:57,558 --> 00:28:59,078
You want a drink?

430
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,843
No. I don't...

431
00:29:01,996 --> 00:29:03,687
My dad was a drunk.

432
00:29:04,518 --> 00:29:05,804
Mine, too.

433
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:17,536
The night my daughter was born,

434
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:21,005
after Tabitha fell asleep,

435
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:25,263
I went to the bar across the
street from the hospital,

436
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:27,556
and I asked the bartender
for the tallest glass

437
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:29,622
of whiskey she could pour,

438
00:29:30,497 --> 00:29:33,435
and I stared at that drink for hours,

439
00:29:35,597 --> 00:29:39,904
and I promised myself I would be
a better father to my kids...

440
00:29:41,307 --> 00:29:44,450
a better husband to my wife.

441
00:29:55,174 --> 00:29:56,492
What are you doing?

442
00:29:57,817 --> 00:30:01,321
Giving you the chance
to renew your vows.

443
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,071
Sit there as long as you like.

444
00:30:05,874 --> 00:30:07,860
I could use the company.

445
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,899
What is this?

446
00:30:17,648 --> 00:30:18,875
I don't know.

447
00:30:20,438 --> 00:30:22,057
But if I tell you something,

448
00:30:22,082 --> 00:30:24,781
can you promise that you
won't tell Mom and Dad?

449
00:30:25,928 --> 00:30:27,532
Ever since I woke up,

450
00:30:28,337 --> 00:30:30,105
something has been happening in me.

451
00:30:30,352 --> 00:30:32,688
I... I hear things in my head.

452
00:30:33,005 --> 00:30:35,133
What kind of things?

453
00:30:37,883 --> 00:30:39,616
I hear people screaming.

454
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:41,524
And it won't stop.

455
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,203
But yesterday,

456
00:30:46,731 --> 00:30:50,383
I was out here with Randall,
and when I saw this place...

457
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,804
everything went quiet

458
00:30:55,046 --> 00:30:57,062
for the first time since I woke up.

459
00:30:58,438 --> 00:31:00,461
But that's good, right?

460
00:31:01,724 --> 00:31:03,196
I don't know.

461
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:08,656
I feel...

462
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,899
I feel like something...

463
00:31:12,032 --> 00:31:14,110
Like it wants me to go in here.

464
00:31:16,177 --> 00:31:17,861
And I don't know what to do.

465
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:20,196
It's just a pile of rocks, right?

466
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:23,430
But I'm scared.

467
00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:27,977
So...

468
00:31:28,969 --> 00:31:30,141
what do I do?

469
00:31:31,383 --> 00:31:32,461
What?

470
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:35,258
All I keep thinking about
is that this sounds like

471
00:31:35,447 --> 00:31:37,631
those stories that you always tell us.

472
00:31:37,657 --> 00:31:40,305
If I was a character in
one of those stories...

473
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,453
what would I do?

474
00:31:43,656 --> 00:31:45,015
What would...

475
00:31:45,453 --> 00:31:47,141
What would this be?

476
00:31:50,163 --> 00:31:51,867
You're at a threshold.

477
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:56,078
It's always scary, but...

478
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,953
the hero has to be brave.

479
00:32:01,557 --> 00:32:03,892
We can go in together, if you want.

480
00:32:06,616 --> 00:32:07,687
Yeah.

481
00:32:12,129 --> 00:32:13,339
Ready?

482
00:32:15,287 --> 00:32:16,573
Yeah.

483
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:14,329
No! No! No!

484
00:33:14,502 --> 00:33:16,649
No! No!

485
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:19,235
Julie! Julie!

486
00:33:21,373 --> 00:33:22,791
Help!

487
00:33:24,423 --> 00:33:27,779
Victor, do you remember where you were

488
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,688
when you heard Jasper talk?

489
00:33:29,953 --> 00:33:32,373
It was dark in a basement.

490
00:33:34,191 --> 00:33:35,985
Do you remember which basement?

491
00:33:36,011 --> 00:33:38,352
No, I don't... No, I don't remember.

492
00:33:38,378 --> 00:33:40,170
- Victor, it's fine.
- Yeah.

493
00:33:40,196 --> 00:33:43,204
- What were you doing in the basement?
- I don't remember!

494
00:33:43,516 --> 00:33:45,281
- I don't remember.
- Hey, don't do...

495
00:33:45,307 --> 00:33:46,773
Was it nice that day?

496
00:33:47,955 --> 00:33:49,173
What?

497
00:33:49,664 --> 00:33:52,149
The day you heard Jasper talk...

498
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,154
what was it like outside?

499
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,220
It was sunny. It was... I was...

500
00:33:57,772 --> 00:33:59,498
We were playing.

501
00:33:59,524 --> 00:34:02,954
- Wait. You mean, you and Eloise?
- Yeah.

502
00:34:03,196 --> 00:34:06,037
Yeah. I was... We were
playing hide-and-seek.

503
00:34:06,063 --> 00:34:08,493
- Yeah? - 'Cause Eloise was
good at hide-and-seek.

504
00:34:08,683 --> 00:34:12,194
I could never find her, no
matter how hard I looked.

505
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,345
Okay.

506
00:34:14,493 --> 00:34:17,045
- Where did you look that day, Victor?
- Everywhere.

507
00:34:17,071 --> 00:34:20,619
The bar, the diner,
the houses, the... church.

508
00:34:20,645 --> 00:34:22,391
I looked in the church.

509
00:34:28,407 --> 00:34:30,251
She'd never hid there before.

510
00:34:31,173 --> 00:34:33,048
She said it always scared her,

511
00:34:33,074 --> 00:34:35,301
but I'd already looked everywhere else.

512
00:34:36,062 --> 00:34:38,290
That was where it happened.
That's where...

513
00:34:38,316 --> 00:34:41,071
I saw Jasper talking to
Christopher in the church!

514
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,735
We just need to know
if you saw anything.

515
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:49,149
Did I see someone stab the
old lady in the greenhouse?

516
00:34:49,183 --> 00:34:50,813
- No.
- What about Tillie?

517
00:34:51,282 --> 00:34:53,870
- When was the last time you saw her?
- I don't know. Yesterday morning.

518
00:34:53,896 --> 00:34:56,279
Why aren't you guys talking
to the one person in town

519
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:58,063
who actually murdered someone?

520
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,423
What?

521
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:02,295
Oh, you don't know about Sara?
She doesn't know about Sara.

522
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:05,040
Look, I'm not sure why you
guys are talking to us.

523
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:06,799
It's pretty fuckin'
obvious who did this.

524
00:35:06,824 --> 00:35:09,593
Okay, look, we're gonna
talk to Sara after.

525
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:12,141
- But for right now, let's...
- Didn't she kill your Dad?

526
00:35:14,335 --> 00:35:16,079
The fuck are you defending her for?

527
00:35:20,195 --> 00:35:21,671
Goddamnit, I said no!

528
00:35:21,697 --> 00:35:23,486
Then what is your solution?!

529
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,501
Okay, we are running out of time, okay?!

530
00:35:25,527 --> 00:35:28,124
Maybe... maybe if you explain to them,

531
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,897
all right, and then give
it a little bit of time...

532
00:35:29,923 --> 00:35:32,267
And in the meantime, what? What?

533
00:35:32,293 --> 00:35:33,962
You two are living
out there in a tent?

534
00:35:33,988 --> 00:35:36,624
Yes! We'll have talismans!
We'll be safe!

535
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:39,259
You won't be safe from her!

536
00:35:39,285 --> 00:35:41,720
So, that... is that
what you're afraid of?

537
00:35:41,746 --> 00:35:44,139
- Whatever made her do this...
- She would never hurt me.

538
00:35:44,165 --> 00:35:46,839
She just stabbed someone
in the fucking chest!

539
00:35:47,121 --> 00:35:49,103
Son, listen to me!

540
00:35:50,703 --> 00:35:53,048
I love Fatima. I do.

541
00:35:53,353 --> 00:35:54,603
But we do not know what...

542
00:35:54,629 --> 00:35:56,954
Boyd, look, I have a whole
lot of people up there

543
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,775
just ready to march on
Sara's house with torches...

544
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,079
What's going on?

545
00:36:06,752 --> 00:36:08,275
It wasn't Sara.

546
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,415
Boyd, look, I know you care about her...

547
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:11,931
It was Fatima.

548
00:36:25,154 --> 00:36:27,439
Was what that guy said about
Sara and your dad true?

549
00:36:27,697 --> 00:36:29,197
It's not that simple.

550
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,533
Okay, you didn't think it was
worth mentioning the girl

551
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:33,356
that already murdered two people?

552
00:36:33,718 --> 00:36:35,475
Look, it's just...

553
00:36:36,025 --> 00:36:37,655
she's different now,
and Boyd trusts her.

554
00:36:37,681 --> 00:36:39,452
Who gives a shit what Boyd thinks, okay?

555
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:41,205
- Help!
- You people got a real funny way...

556
00:36:41,231 --> 00:36:42,532
I need help!

557
00:36:43,157 --> 00:36:45,689
- Hey, hey. What's wrong? What's wrong?
- Julie! She's on the ground!

558
00:36:45,715 --> 00:36:48,064
- She's shaking! Come on, we have to help her!
- Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

559
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,939
Tell it to stop!

560
00:37:13,911 --> 00:37:15,781
You have to climb!

561
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,078
What? No. I ca...

562
00:37:20,624 --> 00:37:21,938
I can't!

563
00:37:23,554 --> 00:37:24,720
Wait.

564
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:26,460
Julie?

565
00:37:27,482 --> 00:37:28,977
How do you know my name?

566
00:37:29,454 --> 00:37:31,055
He needs the rope.

567
00:37:32,272 --> 00:37:33,469
Please.

568
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,050
Who is that?

569
00:37:47,321 --> 00:37:48,860
Hey, what... Fuck!

570
00:37:50,031 --> 00:37:51,141
What?

571
00:37:51,572 --> 00:37:54,759
You have to hurry! They'll be back soon.

572
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,141
Okay.

573
00:37:57,705 --> 00:37:58,993
Thank you.

574
00:37:59,461 --> 00:38:02,227
- Who's down there?
- You need to leave.

575
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:04,141
It isn't safe here.

576
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:05,516
Go!

577
00:38:34,283 --> 00:38:35,412
What...

578
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,561
Plea...

579
00:38:42,022 --> 00:38:44,397
No, no, Victor. Can you just
please tell me what's going on?

580
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:46,639
- Where are we?
- We're underneath the town.

581
00:38:46,665 --> 00:38:48,934
This is where the monsters live.

582
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:51,714
This is where they sleep,
but I can get us out.

583
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,123
They what?

584
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:54,858
Mom?

585
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,217
Mom?

586
00:39:11,254 --> 00:39:12,397
Mom?

587
00:39:13,626 --> 00:39:15,215
Anghkooey!

588
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,872
Anghkooey!

589
00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:19,013
Anghkooey!

590
00:39:22,077 --> 00:39:23,328
Please...

591
00:39:26,027 --> 00:39:27,145
Julie!

592
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:29,606
- Julie! Julie!
- Just get her up. Julie.

593
00:39:29,632 --> 00:39:31,434
- Julie. Julie.
- All right. I got you.

594
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,716
Just get her up.

595
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,791
Julie!

596
00:39:38,817 --> 00:39:40,138
It's okay. It's okay.

597
00:39:40,196 --> 00:39:41,551
Oh, my God.

598
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,370
What happened?

599
00:39:46,395 --> 00:39:47,880
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

600
00:39:50,337 --> 00:39:52,997
So I took her outta town
before everyone woke up.

601
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,223
You need to bring her back.

602
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,632
I can't do that. Not yet.

603
00:39:58,658 --> 00:40:00,702
- Not until we...
- Until you what?

604
00:40:02,287 --> 00:40:04,434
Manage to resurrect Tillie?

605
00:40:09,304 --> 00:40:11,270
Look, I don't wanna...

606
00:40:12,848 --> 00:40:15,942
I love Fatima as though she were my own.

607
00:40:15,967 --> 00:40:18,791
But we have a town we have
to worry about here, Boyd.

608
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:21,130
And if you try to hide this,
and people find out...

609
00:40:21,156 --> 00:40:22,763
They will understand.

610
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:25,270
- Just like they did with Sara.
- Is that what you think?

611
00:40:25,615 --> 00:40:27,912
- You think they understood about Sara?
- Yes.

612
00:40:27,937 --> 00:40:29,518
No, no, no! They didn't understand.

613
00:40:29,544 --> 00:40:31,040
They accepted it.

614
00:40:31,065 --> 00:40:32,411
People swallowed it.

615
00:40:32,437 --> 00:40:35,457
But they certainly did
not understand it.

616
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:38,885
They let it go because you
told them they had to.

617
00:40:38,911 --> 00:40:40,466
Great, then, I will tell them again!

618
00:40:40,491 --> 00:40:42,981
- It's not gonna work this time.
- Why not?

619
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,333
Because they don't
believe in you anymore.

620
00:40:47,837 --> 00:40:49,464
Not like they did.

621
00:40:51,673 --> 00:40:53,026
I'll tell them I did it.

622
00:40:53,052 --> 00:40:54,968
- No, no, no! No, no, no!
- No, no, I did it.

623
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,861
- It's not enough!
- Why?

624
00:40:56,887 --> 00:41:00,299
Because it doesn't change
that it made it happen

625
00:41:00,331 --> 00:41:02,072
in the first place!

626
00:41:02,697 --> 00:41:06,596
There is either something
horrible growing inside of her,

627
00:41:06,622 --> 00:41:09,884
or else this place has
finally broken her mind!

628
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:13,315
Either way, it's only a matter
of time before it happens again!

629
00:41:15,078 --> 00:41:16,537
They can stay with me.

630
00:41:17,613 --> 00:41:19,776
She won't be a threat to anyone else.

631
00:41:19,986 --> 00:41:22,484
- I can watch her. We can watch her.
- No, no, no, Boyd.

632
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:25,781
Boyd, you may both want this to be okay,

633
00:41:25,807 --> 00:41:28,343
and God knows I want it to be okay, too.

634
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:32,541
But if you are not gonna
tell everyone, then I am.

635
00:41:34,632 --> 00:41:37,721
Please, don't make me do this.

636
00:41:57,425 --> 00:41:58,727
What are you doing?

637
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:03,969
You're gonna need supplies.

638
00:42:09,629 --> 00:42:13,508
It was in the basement. It
happened in the basement.

639
00:42:14,792 --> 00:42:17,896
When I opened the door, I heard voices.

640
00:42:18,406 --> 00:42:21,792
So, I was quiet, and I
wanted to get closer.

641
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,239
When I got to the bottom of the stairs,

642
00:42:32,353 --> 00:42:34,716
Jasper was telling secrets.

643
00:42:38,618 --> 00:42:40,840
Christopher got angry.

644
00:42:49,097 --> 00:42:51,367
No, no, that's not right.

645
00:42:51,854 --> 00:42:53,609
It wasn't Jasper.

646
00:42:57,633 --> 00:42:59,336
It was the boy in white.

647
00:42:59,362 --> 00:43:01,656
He was the one that was down here.
He who was...

648
00:43:01,734 --> 00:43:03,820
telling secrets to Christopher.

649
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:11,352
He said, "The answers to the
end are at the beginning."

650
00:43:13,269 --> 00:43:16,020
That it started with the children...

651
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:18,797
What the others did to them.

652
00:43:19,018 --> 00:43:20,662
What others, Victor?

653
00:43:20,897 --> 00:43:22,671
The people they loved.

654
00:43:25,157 --> 00:43:27,187
The people they trusted.

655
00:43:28,007 --> 00:43:30,281
He said the children
were born in the dark.

656
00:43:31,685 --> 00:43:33,470
And then they were murdered...

657
00:43:33,699 --> 00:43:35,064
in the dark.

658
00:43:38,633 --> 00:43:40,570
But someone who loved them...

659
00:43:41,522 --> 00:43:43,469
told them a story.

660
00:43:43,841 --> 00:43:45,984
The story gave them hope.

661
00:43:46,892 --> 00:43:49,960
And when the children
laid on the stones,

662
00:43:50,501 --> 00:43:52,366
they poured their hope

663
00:43:52,391 --> 00:43:54,197
into the roots that made the symbol,

664
00:43:54,223 --> 00:43:56,322
and those roots became the tree.

665
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,007
The Faraway Tree.

666
00:43:58,033 --> 00:44:00,397
The boy in white was
trying to tell Christopher

667
00:44:00,423 --> 00:44:02,548
that to save the children...

668
00:44:03,626 --> 00:44:05,796
he would have to go through the tree.

669
00:44:06,656 --> 00:44:10,001
But he wouldn't listen,
and he got angry.

670
00:44:10,027 --> 00:44:13,392
You're a liar! Everything are lies here!

671
00:44:13,462 --> 00:44:16,447
Christopher wouldn't listen, so I...

672
00:44:21,389 --> 00:44:22,509
What?

673
00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:26,150
Christopher wouldn't
go to the tree, so...

674
00:44:31,344 --> 00:44:34,219
I told my mother what
the boy in white said.

675
00:44:39,574 --> 00:44:41,822
And that's why she left us.

676
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,515
Fatima?

677
00:44:56,225 --> 00:44:57,482
It's Elgin.

678
00:45:02,348 --> 00:45:03,545
You...

679
00:45:07,327 --> 00:45:09,975
Okay, stay close, all right?
But not too close.

680
00:45:10,001 --> 00:45:13,647
Four or five hours out,
that should be, enough.

681
00:45:14,874 --> 00:45:16,151
- Okay.
- And, whatever you do,

682
00:45:16,177 --> 00:45:18,211
you stay off the path to the settlement.

683
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:22,679
Last thing we want is anybody
tripping over your tent.

684
00:45:24,897 --> 00:45:27,944
I'm gonna leave supplies for
you at the shack twice a week.

685
00:45:28,163 --> 00:45:30,460
You need anything, you
leave a note behind.

686
00:45:30,486 --> 00:45:32,409
- Okay.
- You bring a pen and pad?

687
00:45:32,435 --> 00:45:34,078
Yeah, it's in the pack.

688
00:45:34,104 --> 00:45:35,356
And if things...

689
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:39,632
Look, if things get worse,

690
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:42,546
you promise me that you'll...

691
00:45:48,491 --> 00:45:52,460
Look, Dad, I know you
don't want me to do this,

692
00:45:54,647 --> 00:45:56,647
but if you'd had the chance,

693
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:58,576
if you and Mom coulda ran,

694
00:45:58,601 --> 00:46:00,421
even after she did what she did,

695
00:46:00,677 --> 00:46:02,162
what would you have done?

696
00:46:07,057 --> 00:46:08,262
Come on.

697
00:46:09,285 --> 00:46:10,451
Let's go.

698
00:46:10,759 --> 00:46:12,654
Come on. Come on.

699
00:46:31,933 --> 00:46:32,997
No.

700
00:46:33,982 --> 00:46:35,151
Fatima?!

701
00:46:35,505 --> 00:46:36,544
What?

702
00:46:36,689 --> 00:46:37,841
Fatima!

703
00:46:39,043 --> 00:46:40,364
Fatima!

704
00:46:41,404 --> 00:46:42,669
Fatima!

705
00:46:44,982 --> 00:46:46,790
- Almost there.
- Elgin, where are we going?

706
00:46:46,815 --> 00:46:48,232
It's just through here.

707
00:46:48,482 --> 00:46:49,496
It's...

708
00:46:49,786 --> 00:46:52,162
Are you sure we're supposed
to be this close to town?

709
00:46:52,271 --> 00:46:53,802
I told you.

710
00:46:54,406 --> 00:46:56,130
Ellis is waiting for you.

711
00:46:57,154 --> 00:46:58,599
Right here,

712
00:46:59,263 --> 00:47:02,248
there's a room down here

713
00:47:02,274 --> 00:47:04,068
that nobody knows about.

714
00:47:06,745 --> 00:47:09,305
Come on. Please.

715
00:47:10,064 --> 00:47:11,217
Fatima.

716
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,170
It's right through there.

717
00:47:39,324 --> 00:47:40,491
Ellis?

718
00:47:45,373 --> 00:47:48,421
I... I'll wait for him at the shack.

719
00:47:48,447 --> 00:47:50,551
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You can't do that.

720
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:53,241
- Elgin, get out of my way.
- No, you don't understand.

721
00:47:53,267 --> 00:47:54,889
You have to be here.

722
00:47:55,685 --> 00:47:57,897
It's the only place that
the baby will be safe.

723
00:47:58,052 --> 00:48:00,412
- There is no baby.
- Yes, there is.

724
00:48:03,389 --> 00:48:05,030
It's just not yours.

725
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:15,012
Elgin, get out of my way.

726
00:48:15,246 --> 00:48:17,030
Get out of my way! Get out of my...

727
00:48:17,056 --> 00:48:19,520
- Elgin! Get out of my way!
- Fatima!

728
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:27,707
You see?

729
00:48:28,834 --> 00:48:30,567
The baby knows you have to stay.

730
00:48:31,723 --> 00:48:33,111
Elgin, stop.

731
00:48:33,137 --> 00:48:35,731
Fighting it is just
going to make it worse.

732
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:39,320
Elgin, get out of my way.
Please, get out of my way.

733
00:48:39,777 --> 00:48:41,512
Elgin, get out of my way.

734
00:48:41,538 --> 00:48:43,270
Get out of my way!

735
00:48:48,889 --> 00:48:50,090
I'm sorry.

736
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,013
- I really am.
- No, no.

737
00:48:54,039 --> 00:48:55,418
No, no, no, no.

738
00:48:55,444 --> 00:48:56,707
No. No.

739
00:48:56,877 --> 00:48:59,067
- This is for the best.
- No, please.

740
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:00,642
Please, help.

741
00:49:00,668 --> 00:49:02,204
- Help!
- I'm sorry.

742
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,509
Help!

743
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:05,356
Elgin, no.

744
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,127
Elgin, please.

745
00:49:07,777 --> 00:49:09,113
Help!

746
00:49:09,932 --> 00:49:12,996
Help! Help!

747
00:49:15,793 --> 00:49:16,986
Help!
