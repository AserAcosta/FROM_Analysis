00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,593
Previously on From...

2
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,505
Tabby, whatever this is, it's real,

3
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:23,165
and we are stuck.

4
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,864
You're telling me I'm
in a town I can't leave

5
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,950
and that every night monsters
come from the forest.

6
00:00:29,328 --> 00:00:30,333
No!

7
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:32,346
A man protects his family, Frank!

8
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:33,765
Open your eyes and look!

9
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,976
Look at what you've done! Look at them!

10
00:00:37,382 --> 00:00:41,333
And I wish you had the luxury
of grief, but you don't, Boyd.

11
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:42,841
These people need you.

12
00:00:42,867 --> 00:00:45,960
You need to be the one to
lead these people home.

13
00:00:46,218 --> 00:00:47,257
No!

14
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:50,289
Stay with me!

15
00:00:50,315 --> 00:00:53,000
They're losing their leaves...
the trees.

16
00:00:53,026 --> 00:00:55,322
Is it bad that they're
losing their leaves?

17
00:00:55,515 --> 00:00:57,599
When things change here,

18
00:00:57,619 --> 00:00:58,826
it's usually bad.

19
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:01,177
Storm wiped out half our crop.

20
00:01:01,203 --> 00:01:04,476
Gonna have to get real serious about
rations with all the new people.

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,670
Last night, Elgin almost
drowned in his sleep.

22
00:01:10,257 --> 00:01:11,283
He what?

23
00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:13,924
Donna, I was told I can't have kids.

24
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:17,511
With all you've seen, you can't
wrap your head around a miracle?

25
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,513
I saw something that wasn't there.

26
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:21,773
- What?
- I saw two children,

27
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,726
standing in the middle of
the road, staring at me.

28
00:01:25,132 --> 00:01:27,028
The night the bad things happened,

29
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:30,080
when my mother went to save the
children locked in the tower.

30
00:01:30,106 --> 00:01:32,968
- ¡Mum!
- What's wrong? Julie! Julie!

31
00:01:34,632 --> 00:01:37,442
What if the only way to save
Julie is to find that tower?

32
00:01:37,468 --> 00:01:40,156
- Tabby...
- I have to try this, Jim. Please.

33
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:43,320
It's a Faraway tree. Here.

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,335
My mother said it would take her
to the tower, to the children.

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,224
Every time I see something
really weird, I see this symbol.

36
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,067
Tabitha told you she saw this
symbol down in the tunnels.

37
00:01:57,093 --> 00:01:58,882
Anghkooey.

38
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,869
If there's answers to be found,
that's where they'll be.

39
00:02:02,895 --> 00:02:04,656
Anghkooey!

40
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:07,786
Everything was fine until
you went into the forest.

41
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:10,273
I think this is gonna help me fix this.

42
00:02:13,914 --> 00:02:16,929
It's not your fear that
feeds the forest, Boyd.

43
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,239
It's hope.

44
00:02:19,428 --> 00:02:21,280
Let it go, Boyd.

45
00:02:21,355 --> 00:02:23,234
If they don't die today,

46
00:02:23,508 --> 00:02:25,445
they'll just die tomorrow.

47
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:27,109
No.

48
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,684
You don't break me.

49
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:34,046
You hear that?!

50
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:36,960
You don't fucking break me!

51
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,812
I'm sorry. This is the only way.

52
00:02:42,984 --> 00:02:45,539
- Where am I?
- St. Anthony's Hospital.

53
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:48,435
Three days ago, a pair of
hikers found you in the woods.

54
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,390
You were lying unconscious
on the side of a trail.

55
00:02:59,273 --> 00:03:02,148
You said "St. Anthony's
Hospital," but where is this?

56
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,718
You're in Camden.

57
00:03:05,003 --> 00:03:06,226
Maine.

58
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:10,812
Can you tell me your name?

59
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,843
What?

60
00:03:15,357 --> 00:03:18,001
You were found without
any identification.

61
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:21,164
Can you tell me anything
about what happened to you?

62
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,070
Where did you get those
cuts and bruises?

63
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:29,538
I...

64
00:03:30,781 --> 00:03:32,550
- Why don't you have a seat?
- It's okay.

65
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:35,437
It's all right. No one's gonna hurt you.

66
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:40,694
Is there someone we can call?

67
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:42,715
A family member?

68
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:46,832
No.

69
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,728
Dr. Brody?

70
00:03:49,726 --> 00:03:51,320
The police are on their way.

71
00:03:51,707 --> 00:03:53,070
Thank you.

72
00:03:55,882 --> 00:03:58,249
- Why...
- It's just a formality.

73
00:03:58,275 --> 00:04:01,085
We all just want to make sure
you're okay, that's all.

74
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:04,513
Now that you're awake,

75
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:07,308
I'd also like to run a few tests,
if you're feeling up to it.

76
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:08,773
Would that be all right?

77
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:12,261
I'm gonna step outside for a minute,

78
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:14,281
but I'll be right down the hall.

79
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,070
Sit tight and rest, all right?

80
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:58,193
Hey!

81
00:06:59,247 --> 00:07:01,202
Hey! Look where you're going!

82
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,381
What do you mean, "It's the only way"?

83
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,566
Get your hands off him.

84
00:07:45,863 --> 00:07:47,423
I'm so sorry. I'm...

85
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:49,210
What's wrong with you?

86
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,499
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

87
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,217
www.subtitulamos.tv

88
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,455
Shouldn't Kristi be doing that?

89
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:13,297
Kristi's got other things on her mind.

90
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,382
She has to look after Marielle.

91
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,886
Right.

92
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:19,720
How are they, by the way...

93
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:21,817
Marielle, Randall, and Julie?

94
00:10:22,586 --> 00:10:23,871
They seem fine.

95
00:10:26,317 --> 00:10:27,252
What?

96
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,322
The fact that you can look
at anything right now

97
00:10:29,348 --> 00:10:31,020
and describe it as "fine"

98
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:33,150
has a bewildering charm to it.

99
00:10:33,176 --> 00:10:35,068
Yeah, well, we're still here, right?

100
00:10:35,225 --> 00:10:37,674
One of your own people tried
to kill you three days ago.

101
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:40,789
Half the town is still
afraid to go to sleep,

102
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:43,614
you have a food shortage
with no solution,

103
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,079
I'm not sure if you've noticed...

104
00:10:46,754 --> 00:10:50,371
- it's getting pretty cold outside.
- Yeah, well, we got blankets.

105
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:53,170
Oh, right, yeah, I forgot
about the blankets.

106
00:10:53,196 --> 00:10:55,006
Never mind. I guess we're fine then.

107
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:56,944
What do you want me to do?

108
00:10:57,274 --> 00:10:58,739
Scream "fire"?

109
00:10:59,114 --> 00:11:00,770
Get everybody panicked?

110
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,692
Maybe they aren't panicked enough.

111
00:11:04,118 --> 00:11:07,013
Maybe you aren't panicked enough.

112
00:11:07,637 --> 00:11:10,543
You know, when I was in that chamber,

113
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:14,149
about to smash the, music box,

114
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:16,443
that thing that was talking to me,

115
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,793
telling me to give up,

116
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:21,990
that hope is what the forest fed on.

117
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:24,387
That thing, whatever it was,

118
00:11:24,757 --> 00:11:26,895
it sure as hell wasn't my wife.

119
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:30,200
So, what are you?

120
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:34,590
I'm afraid I can't answer
that for you, Boyd.

121
00:11:35,548 --> 00:11:36,746
Stop!

122
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,465
No! Let me go!

123
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,606
We have to help her! Stop! Let me go!

124
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:55,442
Let me go!

125
00:11:56,739 --> 00:11:58,652
No! Let me go!

126
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:00,035
Ethan!

127
00:12:00,957 --> 00:12:02,823
We've been looking everywhere for you.

128
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:04,668
You told them, didn't you?

129
00:12:04,694 --> 00:12:07,606
- Hey, I'm talking to you.
- Why'd you tell them?

130
00:12:09,843 --> 00:12:11,847
We have to go find Mom!

131
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,334
We can't just leave her out there.

132
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,293
- We have to do something.
- I know.

133
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,590
Just, go inside, all right? Just go.

134
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,020
Dad!

135
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:25,817
You found him.

136
00:12:27,135 --> 00:12:28,219
Good.

137
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,137
Hey...

138
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:35,606
Yeah, I... I'm gonna go for a walk.

139
00:12:36,563 --> 00:12:37,621
Julie.

140
00:12:39,618 --> 00:12:41,375
It's not your fault, Dad.

141
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:43,762
None of this is your fault.

142
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:53,716
Jim.

143
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,164
You know you can't do this.

144
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,256
I never should have let her go.

145
00:13:06,282 --> 00:13:07,599
- I'm not gonna just sit around.
- Jim,

146
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,477
you can't be in the woods overnight.

147
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,482
My son just tried to run away so
that he could go look for her.

148
00:13:12,614 --> 00:13:14,834
My daughter is still
refusing to talk about

149
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,219
whatever happened to her when she...

150
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:20,734
My kids need their mom.

151
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:22,342
What am I supposed to do?

152
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,516
I don't know. But it can't be this.

153
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:26,689
I'll keep a talisman in the tent.

154
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:32,329
Jim, wait. Jim!

155
00:13:32,547 --> 00:13:34,485
Listen, I... Jim!

156
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:37,560
I already tried that, when I
went into the woods with Sara,

157
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:41,157
and our tent got dragged God
knows where by God knows what.

158
00:13:41,336 --> 00:13:43,029
You still made it back okay.

159
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,907
Yeah, by the skin of my goddamn teeth.

160
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:46,469
I'm not having this conversation.

161
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:49,493
You know as well as I do that
the odds are she's already...

162
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,711
Don't!

163
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,579
Don't you fucking dare.

164
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,836
What's goin' on?

165
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:01,316
I'm gonna go look for my wife.

166
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,778
All right, wait, just hold on a second.

167
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:06,445
If you're gonna go,

168
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:09,610
there might be a safer way to do this.

169
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,705
Come on! You've been in there
almost an hour already!

170
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,123
Just give me a second.

171
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:20,618
You said that 15 minutes ago! Come on!

172
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,290
I can't wait any longer!

173
00:14:38,221 --> 00:14:40,718
Hurry up! What are you doing in there?

174
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,803
It's bad enough you're
getting double rations

175
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:56,805
without you hogging the bathroom.

176
00:14:56,844 --> 00:14:58,581
Back off, Nicky.

177
00:14:58,607 --> 00:14:59,833
Eat shit, Clara.

178
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,878
Hey, is there a problem?

179
00:15:01,904 --> 00:15:04,602
Yeah, there's a problem. I'm
about to piss on the floor.

180
00:15:07,425 --> 00:15:08,813
Screw her.

181
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,344
You doing okay?

182
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:12,985
Yeah, I'm fine.

183
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,618
Baby, you really gotta eat something.

184
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,805
I will. I just...

185
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,360
My stomach just hasn't been right.

186
00:15:22,272 --> 00:15:23,540
I just gotta rest.

187
00:15:23,753 --> 00:15:25,961
There's two of you I
gotta worry about now.

188
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,907
I'll be okay.

189
00:15:36,071 --> 00:15:38,627
The first couple of months
can be hard, but...

190
00:15:38,653 --> 00:15:41,047
- Yeah.
- she'll be all right.

191
00:15:44,798 --> 00:15:47,172
Ellis, we've got work to do.

192
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,050
Isn't it too soon to harvest?

193
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,779
We've already lost half
our crop to the storm.

194
00:15:52,805 --> 00:15:55,100
I don't wanna risk losing
what little we have left,

195
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:57,336
hoping the ground doesn't freeze.

196
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,485
Has he slept yet?

197
00:16:02,484 --> 00:16:03,626
I don't know.

198
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:07,119
We got bigger things to deal with.

199
00:16:07,145 --> 00:16:10,016
Round up some bodies.
Meet me out in the field.

200
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:15,006
The day that Sara and I found
the lighthouse in the woods,

201
00:16:15,032 --> 00:16:17,185
we started out at the little stone hut

202
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:18,620
where I found the talismans.

203
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:23,506
We were also in a tent that
got dragged who knows where.

204
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:26,928
But if you start out in
the hut each morning,

205
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:29,623
you're at least starting closer
to what you're trying to find,

206
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:31,459
and you've got a place to
come back to at night,

207
00:16:31,485 --> 00:16:33,021
so you don't get yourself killed.

208
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:35,243
Makes sense. Thanks.

209
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:38,563
Wait. You said you and Sara
both made camp in there?

210
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,118
Yeah. Why?

211
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:43,609
I'm gonna go with him.

212
00:16:44,894 --> 00:16:46,782
Can I talk to you outside?

213
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,967
Look, look, I know what
you're gonna say, okay?

214
00:16:58,993 --> 00:17:01,170
But there's no way we can
let him go out there alone.

215
00:17:01,196 --> 00:17:03,623
I get... I get why you're
afraid to go back...

216
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,543
- I am not afraid...
- Yes! Yes, you are,

217
00:17:06,852 --> 00:17:09,868
and you've got a lot of
reasons to be, Boyd.

218
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,998
But someone's gotta make sure

219
00:17:13,024 --> 00:17:14,631
that Jim comes back in one piece.

220
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:16,342
I know what it's like
to lose a parent here,

221
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,872
and I'm not gonna watch Julie and Ethan

222
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:20,157
lose both their parents
in the same week.

223
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,711
We can't play defense forever, Boyd.

224
00:17:27,016 --> 00:17:28,623
What the fuck?

225
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:33,156
What the fuck is...

226
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,305
Jade?

227
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,954
They tried to show me.

228
00:17:43,469 --> 00:17:44,852
I don't see it.

229
00:17:44,949 --> 00:17:49,118
I can't. I can't see it. I can't see it.

230
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,711
They tried to show me.

231
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,649
What's he talking about?

232
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:55,896
No idea.

233
00:17:55,922 --> 00:17:58,006
- I don't understand it.
- Did you know about this?

234
00:17:58,032 --> 00:17:59,545
They're trying to show me.

235
00:17:59,571 --> 00:18:02,704
I mean, I knew he was pretty obsessed
with that drawing, but this is...

236
00:18:03,321 --> 00:18:04,389
insane.

237
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,019
I can't... I can't see it.

238
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:09,602
I can't... Fuck. I can't see it.

239
00:18:11,629 --> 00:18:13,209
Yeah, I'll get that boarded up.

240
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:14,709
- No.
- I can't see it.

241
00:18:14,735 --> 00:18:16,842
Help me take him back to the station.

242
00:18:16,868 --> 00:18:19,224
- He can sleep it off.
- I can't see it. I can't.

243
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,696
- I'm gonna help you, buddy.
- No, no.

244
00:18:20,722 --> 00:18:23,601
- No, no, no, no. It's all right.
- Come on... Ok.

245
00:18:23,627 --> 00:18:25,085
- Let's do this.
- I gotta see... I gotta...

246
00:18:25,111 --> 00:18:26,596
- No, no.
- I gotta figure this out!

247
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:28,275
Just stand up. Ready?

248
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:46,716
It's so cute.

249
00:18:47,037 --> 00:18:48,858
It's amazing, like...

250
00:18:48,884 --> 00:18:50,218
Look at this.

251
00:18:53,121 --> 00:18:54,982
Oh, that's really cute.

252
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:00,318
Let me get one of the two of us.

253
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,042
- What's wrong?
- Excuse me.

254
00:19:08,642 --> 00:19:09,659
Hi.

255
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:13,753
Would it be possible for me
to borrow one of your phones?

256
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:15,833
- No.
- Please.

257
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:18,378
- Will you be quick?
- Yeah.

258
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:21,209
Thank you.

259
00:19:23,484 --> 00:19:25,050
Why would you do that?

260
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:30,800
Okay.

261
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,972
Hello?

262
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,307
Mom?

263
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,011
Tabby? Oh, God! Tabby! Where are you?

264
00:19:43,354 --> 00:19:44,667
Mom, hi....

265
00:19:45,206 --> 00:19:47,651
- I'm okay. We're all okay.
- Ay, mija!

266
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:49,806
Yeah.

267
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,308
Where have you been?

268
00:19:55,714 --> 00:19:57,839
We had to go for a little while, but...

269
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,173
And you went where?

270
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:01,211
I just don't want you to worry, Mom.

271
00:20:01,237 --> 00:20:03,758
No, Tabby, the police
are looking for you

272
00:20:03,784 --> 00:20:06,321
and Jim and the kids.
Everybody's been looking!

273
00:20:06,346 --> 00:20:08,315
I know. I know, Mom. I know.

274
00:20:08,463 --> 00:20:10,641
- I'm so sorry.
- Ay, mi amor.

275
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,925
I'm gonna tell you everything
as soon as I see you.

276
00:20:12,951 --> 00:20:14,534
Please! Por favor!

277
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:15,987
I just...

278
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:17,952
We have been so worried!

279
00:20:18,065 --> 00:20:21,029
I just wanted to hear your voice
and for you to hear mine.

280
00:20:21,642 --> 00:20:22,753
Tabby!

281
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,243
Mom, I love you so much,
and I miss you and...

282
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:26,456
Mi amor.

283
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:30,430
Jim and I are doing everything
we can to come back home soon.

284
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:31,539
Ay, que bueno.

285
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:33,235
Everyone says hello.

286
00:20:33,261 --> 00:20:36,336
- Ay, Tabby, please, just stay on the phone.
- No, no, no.

287
00:20:36,394 --> 00:20:38,504
There's a police detective.
He gave me his card.

288
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,033
Mom, Mom, I-I... I can't
stay here for long.

289
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:42,244
I'm sorry....

290
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,581
Okay, but you have to call him.

291
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:46,678
Mi amor.

292
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:49,453
You might not hear from me
for a little bit, but...

293
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:51,453
No, no, no! No, no, no!

294
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:53,854
- You have to stay here!
- I just don't want you to be afraid.

295
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,855
I'm okay, okay? Everything's okay.

296
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,081
¿Ay, pero cuándo?

297
00:20:57,121 --> 00:20:58,597
- I love you, Mom.
- Tabby!

298
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,656
I'm so sorry, Mom. I have to go.

299
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,901
I love you so much, okay?
Everything's okay.

300
00:21:03,927 --> 00:21:05,659
Mom, I love you. Bye.

301
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,847
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

302
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:14,966
Why would you do that?

303
00:21:14,992 --> 00:21:17,542
You seriously need to
disinfect your phone now.

304
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,229
When are you guys leaving?

305
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,964
As soon as Jim's ready.

306
00:21:42,144 --> 00:21:45,698
My mom insisted on putting
together our rations.

307
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,511
Yeah, Moms'll do that.

308
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:48,722
Yep.

309
00:21:49,081 --> 00:21:51,583
Are you sure about all this?

310
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,511
Mom, that's too much. We can't...

311
00:21:54,964 --> 00:21:57,698
_

312
00:21:57,723 --> 00:21:59,723
_

313
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:02,847
_

314
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:05,683
- Ma...
- _

315
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:07,636
- Yes.
- _

316
00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:10,831
_

317
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:14,721
_

318
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,019
It's gonna be fine!

319
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,042
You guys worry too much.

320
00:22:29,663 --> 00:22:31,889
Are you really gonna go find Mom?

321
00:22:33,748 --> 00:22:35,615
Well, I'm gonna do my best.

322
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:40,019
But I can't do that if I'm
worried about things back here.

323
00:22:40,045 --> 00:22:42,128
So, no more running off, okay?

324
00:22:43,212 --> 00:22:44,319
Okay.

325
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:46,983
Shake on it.

326
00:22:48,632 --> 00:22:49,772
Good man.

327
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:55,858
I love you, Dad.

328
00:22:56,728 --> 00:22:58,330
I love you, too.

329
00:22:58,356 --> 00:23:00,022
Promise you'll be careful?

330
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,092
I promise.

331
00:23:13,663 --> 00:23:15,115
I'll be back soon.

332
00:23:20,146 --> 00:23:21,881
- Yeah.
- You got it. Okay.

333
00:23:22,498 --> 00:23:24,647
You ready? We're burning daylight.

334
00:23:24,713 --> 00:23:26,155
- Yeah.
- 'Kay.

335
00:23:26,264 --> 00:23:28,549
Right, and remember what I
told you about those trees.

336
00:23:28,756 --> 00:23:30,899
You start seeing spiderwebs,
then you know you are going

337
00:23:30,925 --> 00:23:32,636
- in the right direction.
- Yeah, got it.

338
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:35,574
And whatever you do, make sure
you get back to the hut by dark.

339
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Yeah. We're gonna be okay.

340
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,811
Okay? I'll see you soon.

341
00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:41,194
Okay.

342
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:45,650
Dad!

343
00:23:47,505 --> 00:23:49,280
You gotta come to the fields.

344
00:23:49,924 --> 00:23:51,022
Come on.

345
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,990
Let's see what we can dig up...

346
00:23:57,813 --> 00:23:59,764
No, no. Please.

347
00:23:59,922 --> 00:24:02,912
What are we gonna do?
They're all fuckin' rotten.

348
00:24:07,443 --> 00:24:08,724
Donna!

349
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,269
First things we pulled up,

350
00:24:13,295 --> 00:24:16,889
it was a few rotten carrots,
beets and potatoes.

351
00:24:17,326 --> 00:24:20,434
So, we pulled up some more.
They were rotten too.

352
00:24:21,123 --> 00:24:24,794
Everything that survived
the storm is rotten.

353
00:24:26,822 --> 00:24:28,709
Boyd, we're out of food.

354
00:24:30,112 --> 00:24:32,172
How many people did you
have up here with you?

355
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:33,972
Donna!

356
00:24:34,045 --> 00:24:35,448
How many people know?

357
00:24:36,381 --> 00:24:38,433
Go! You go home now!

358
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:41,136
Look, I'm sorry, okay? But every
ounce of food we have left

359
00:24:41,162 --> 00:24:43,089
is in those jars in your basement!

360
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:45,626
You have no right to keep
it locked away down there!

361
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,087
No! Those for everybody!

362
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,928
- There more crop coming!
- You don't know what you're talking about.

363
00:24:50,954 --> 00:24:52,644
Everything else is rotten.

364
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,410
- This is all the food we have now!
- No!

365
00:24:55,436 --> 00:24:56,804
Please go home!

366
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,264
Go home!

367
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,998
No, my house! No!

368
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:03,552
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

369
00:25:03,693 --> 00:25:06,856
You're not... Look, kid, I don't
like this any more than you do,

370
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,608
but the shit is on the fan, all right?

371
00:25:08,912 --> 00:25:10,880
- You can't! She's my friend!
- Enough.

372
00:25:10,906 --> 00:25:12,521
Stop! Stop!

373
00:25:13,427 --> 00:25:14,714
The kid is one thing,

374
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,216
- but you, I'm gonna fucking hit, all right?
- Randall, what are you doing?

375
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:19,240
I said, "Stop."

376
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,927
Victor, don't.

377
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,115
- No, no, no!
- Just stop.

378
00:25:22,141 --> 00:25:24,849
No, no! Hey, hey! Stop, stop, stop!
Victor?

379
00:25:26,787 --> 00:25:28,394
So, this guy's got a gun?
Are you fucking kidding me?

380
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,630
Is that seriously what you're
focusing on right now?

381
00:25:32,459 --> 00:25:33,896
Put it down, buddy.

382
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:35,841
Victor?

383
00:25:36,473 --> 00:25:37,677
Victor.

384
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,607
Put it down.

385
00:25:42,012 --> 00:25:43,826
All right. Okay.

386
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:45,990
- Now, give me the gun, buddy.
- No.

387
00:25:47,843 --> 00:25:49,224
Please, buddy.

388
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:57,858
Great.

389
00:25:57,884 --> 00:25:59,492
Can I take my goat now?

390
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:03,944
Those animals are off-limits.

391
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,959
Those animals are the only
food that we have now.

392
00:26:05,985 --> 00:26:07,166
That's right.

393
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:09,811
They provide eggs. They provide milk.

394
00:26:09,837 --> 00:26:11,592
They are a resource.

395
00:26:11,618 --> 00:26:13,152
And if you hadn't noticed,

396
00:26:13,178 --> 00:26:16,223
we're running pretty fucking
thin on those these days.

397
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:18,767
Listen,

398
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,368
what happened today...

399
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:26,767
What happened today was a
setback, and I get it.

400
00:26:27,415 --> 00:26:30,631
I get that we're scared. I get that...
I get that we're hungry.

401
00:26:30,657 --> 00:26:32,025
But we are...

402
00:26:33,571 --> 00:26:35,462
Look, we are still in this thing.

403
00:26:36,797 --> 00:26:38,186
We can still win.

404
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:43,077
But whatever we do, we
have to do it carefully.

405
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:46,040
We have to make everything last.

406
00:26:47,142 --> 00:26:48,189
Okay?

407
00:26:50,587 --> 00:26:52,753
This place will not break us!

408
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,423
The only way we go home...

409
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,837
is together.

410
00:26:59,253 --> 00:27:00,379
Okay?

411
00:27:02,283 --> 00:27:03,392
So...

412
00:27:04,003 --> 00:27:07,954
So, give us time to figure this out.

413
00:27:08,934 --> 00:27:10,314
Give me that.

414
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,431
Or...

415
00:27:17,743 --> 00:27:19,133
we can do this,

416
00:27:19,461 --> 00:27:22,196
right here, right now.

417
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:28,141
Just give him the goat.

418
00:27:29,395 --> 00:27:31,587
You people don't have any fucking idea.

419
00:27:32,895 --> 00:27:34,196
You don't.

420
00:27:38,735 --> 00:27:40,887
- Thank you.
- Whatever.

421
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:43,763
Hey, bud.

422
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:45,606
- You okay?
- You okay?

423
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,477
Should we take Alma back?

424
00:27:47,864 --> 00:27:49,707
- Hey, could you...?
- Yeah.

425
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:50,989
Come on, Alma.

426
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,106
I appreciate what you're doing.

427
00:27:57,588 --> 00:27:59,239
I want you to know that.

428
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:02,543
Coming out here with me... thank you.

429
00:28:02,817 --> 00:28:04,283
You don't have to thank me.

430
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,510
Yeah, I do. I do.

431
00:28:06,536 --> 00:28:08,895
Look, we're gonna do everything we can.

432
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:11,301
We're gonna be safe, and
we're gonna be smart.

433
00:28:15,989 --> 00:28:17,231
What the fuck?

434
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:26,515
Hey, Jim, wait.

435
00:28:33,251 --> 00:28:35,191
We should turn around.

436
00:29:22,065 --> 00:29:25,063
Jim, we should head back
to the talisman hut.

437
00:29:25,187 --> 00:29:26,571
It's gonna get dark soon.

438
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:32,037
These look pretty solid.

439
00:29:32,694 --> 00:29:35,524
We could just hang the talisman
in one of these things,

440
00:29:35,571 --> 00:29:37,350
start from here in the morning.

441
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:38,686
You're serious?

442
00:29:38,712 --> 00:29:41,209
What's the difference of
sleeping in one of these things

443
00:29:41,235 --> 00:29:42,709
or sleeping in the talisman hut?

444
00:29:42,735 --> 00:29:44,428
Boyd said, if we saw
spiderwebs in the trees,

445
00:29:44,454 --> 00:29:45,970
then we'd know we were heading
in the right direction.

446
00:29:45,996 --> 00:29:48,804
He didn't say anything
about weird statues and...

447
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:52,556
Maybe Boyd's tent got
dragged past all this.

448
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:55,842
Ok.

449
00:29:55,923 --> 00:29:58,335
If we're gonna spend the night here,
we should take a look around,

450
00:29:58,361 --> 00:29:59,892
make sure there's no surprises.

451
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,500
All right.

452
00:30:01,713 --> 00:30:03,494
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

453
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,335
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

454
00:30:24,718 --> 00:30:27,362
I can't really remember when
my last confession was.

455
00:30:27,388 --> 00:30:29,647
You're here now. That's what matters.

456
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:35,391
I needed to talk to someone, and
I didn't know where else to go.

457
00:30:38,412 --> 00:30:42,389
I can't tell anyone who
I am, that I'm here.

458
00:30:43,496 --> 00:30:45,131
They'll think I'm crazy.

459
00:30:46,765 --> 00:30:48,467
I just called my mom.

460
00:30:48,865 --> 00:30:51,576
That may have done more harm than good.
I don't know.

461
00:30:53,222 --> 00:30:55,307
I don't know how I got here.

462
00:30:59,053 --> 00:31:01,294
Nothing that I've been
through is possible.

463
00:31:03,807 --> 00:31:06,091
I feel like my mind is breaking.

464
00:31:08,435 --> 00:31:11,489
Whenever we reach our limits,

465
00:31:11,716 --> 00:31:13,722
God will always be there
to break our fall.

466
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,558
No, no, no. Please...

467
00:31:15,637 --> 00:31:17,184
Please don't do that.

468
00:31:20,035 --> 00:31:22,230
I didn't come here to talk about God.

469
00:31:22,552 --> 00:31:23,871
Why not?

470
00:31:23,994 --> 00:31:27,302
Because if God is real, then
He made that horrible place.

471
00:31:29,168 --> 00:31:31,795
He created all the pain and suffering.

472
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:36,763
He was the one that let my baby
fall off that changing table.

473
00:31:38,666 --> 00:31:41,083
I'm sorry, Father. This was a mistake.

474
00:31:45,091 --> 00:31:47,381
- Please, wait.
- I'm fine. It's okay.

475
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,149
What was his name?

476
00:31:51,021 --> 00:31:52,157
What?

477
00:31:52,751 --> 00:31:54,513
Your child, the one you lost,

478
00:31:54,716 --> 00:31:56,055
What was his name?

479
00:32:00,616 --> 00:32:02,054
Thomas.

480
00:32:04,263 --> 00:32:05,587
That's a good name.

481
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:09,227
You have other children?

482
00:32:12,443 --> 00:32:13,766
The lunchbox.

483
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:19,212
This belongs to a man named Victor.

484
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:23,868
He fixed me a snack before I left.

485
00:32:25,031 --> 00:32:26,751
Before you left where?

486
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:33,329
A place where monsters
come out at night.

487
00:32:34,712 --> 00:32:36,602
A place that no one can leave.

488
00:32:39,055 --> 00:32:40,132
But, see,

489
00:32:40,454 --> 00:32:42,894
I went through a tree that
took me to a lighthouse.

490
00:32:42,977 --> 00:32:44,749
And then, a little boy
pushed me out, saying,

491
00:32:44,775 --> 00:32:46,266
"This is the only way."

492
00:32:46,734 --> 00:32:48,359
The only way to what?

493
00:32:49,202 --> 00:32:50,923
I don't... I don't know.

494
00:32:52,176 --> 00:32:55,813
I have no clue what I'm supposed
to do here or where to go.

495
00:32:58,102 --> 00:33:00,735
My family is trapped
in a terrifying place,

496
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:02,594
and I don't know how
to get back to them.

497
00:33:06,842 --> 00:33:08,781
What kind of snack did Victor make?

498
00:33:10,236 --> 00:33:11,844
You think I'm crazy, right?

499
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,446
I think you're in pain,

500
00:33:16,676 --> 00:33:18,985
and I'd like to help, if I can.

501
00:33:20,681 --> 00:33:21,954
Humor me.

502
00:33:40,156 --> 00:33:42,450
He's still such a little boy Victor.

503
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,853
What it must have been like for him,

504
00:33:45,879 --> 00:33:48,211
growing up alone in a place like that.

505
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:50,303
_

506
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,827
_

507
00:33:52,092 --> 00:33:53,896
Oh, my God. I have to go.

508
00:33:53,922 --> 00:33:55,092
There's no need to rush.

509
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:58,211
No, it's okay, it's okay. I
know where to go. Thank you!

510
00:34:08,604 --> 00:34:11,594
You know, this place isn't half bad

511
00:34:11,729 --> 00:34:13,971
once you have the right hobby.

512
00:34:14,956 --> 00:34:17,565
You really need to get some rest.

513
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:20,576
Boyd said it was okay to sleep again.

514
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,401
It's not that. It's...

515
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,497
I feel like something is watching me.

516
00:34:25,846 --> 00:34:29,409
But then, I wake up and I
can never remember. I-I...

517
00:34:31,363 --> 00:34:32,776
Is that her?

518
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,932
She looks scary.

519
00:34:57,583 --> 00:34:59,740
The one thing that has
kept people hanging on

520
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:02,150
is the fact that we still
had crops coming in.

521
00:35:02,176 --> 00:35:03,926
Well, they're gone.

522
00:35:04,348 --> 00:35:06,739
So, now we gotta figure
out what comes next.

523
00:35:07,255 --> 00:35:08,622
Right...

524
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,674
So, then, what do we have
left in terms of rations?

525
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,322
Left? We don't have anything left.

526
00:35:14,348 --> 00:35:16,877
What little we had just walked
out the door in a panic!

527
00:35:16,903 --> 00:35:19,223
- Then we get it back.
- And then what?

528
00:35:19,294 --> 00:35:22,722
Even if we get everything
they took, which we won't,

529
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:24,792
it will still be nowhere near enough!

530
00:35:26,564 --> 00:35:28,300
Then, we gotta talk about the animals.

531
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,815
We gotta figure out if
those animals out there

532
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:33,434
can feed everyone long
enough to plant a new crop.

533
00:35:33,512 --> 00:35:36,286
The soil is poisoned!

534
00:35:36,817 --> 00:35:40,028
- Everything is poisoned!
- All right, so, you wanna give up?

535
00:35:41,718 --> 00:35:43,098
Look at me!

536
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:45,728
Should we just lay down and die?

537
00:35:45,785 --> 00:35:47,435
Because I'm not ready to do that!

538
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:49,880
We got one resource left! One!

539
00:35:50,044 --> 00:35:53,536
And we start killing those animals
without a plan, we are done!

540
00:35:53,973 --> 00:35:57,709
You wanna be the one to tell Fatima her
baby's gonna starve before it's born?

541
00:35:57,735 --> 00:35:59,036
Go ahead!

542
00:36:00,982 --> 00:36:03,380
We plant smaller crop.

543
00:36:04,598 --> 00:36:06,225
Different places.

544
00:36:06,353 --> 00:36:07,841
Different soil.

545
00:36:13,286 --> 00:36:14,375
Okay.

546
00:36:15,483 --> 00:36:17,578
Let's say we do that.

547
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:22,726
We need those animals to buy us...

548
00:36:23,994 --> 00:36:25,203
three months?

549
00:36:25,524 --> 00:36:26,953
We got enough for that?

550
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:31,180
If we slaughter the cows one at a time,

551
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:34,687
they could last us at least a month.

552
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,523
Maybe more.

553
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:39,727
How about the goats?

554
00:36:40,971 --> 00:36:42,445
We can...

555
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,852
Ethan.

556
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,522
Hey.

557
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:10,373
Hey.

558
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:13,960
Mind if I join you?

559
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:18,381
Sure.

560
00:37:22,028 --> 00:37:24,740
I guess you heard what we
were talking about in there.

561
00:37:27,224 --> 00:37:29,912
You have to kill the
animals to feed the town.

562
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,084
Yeah.

563
00:37:35,264 --> 00:37:37,303
Can't you find another way?

564
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,568
I wish I could do that.

565
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,303
I really do.

566
00:37:46,439 --> 00:37:47,831
Those animals down there...

567
00:37:48,803 --> 00:37:50,521
they're gonna save us.

568
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:53,308
They're gonna keep everybody alive

569
00:37:53,334 --> 00:37:55,365
till we figure all this out.

570
00:37:56,064 --> 00:37:57,607
They're gonna be heroes.

571
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:02,318
Can you make sure Alma goes first?

572
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:04,153
Why?

573
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:08,982
'Cause then she won't have
to watch her friends die.

574
00:38:36,128 --> 00:38:39,112
_

575
00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:04,484
Oh, for Christ's sake.

576
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:07,446
Get lost. I'm not in the mood.

577
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:09,681
Do you hear me? Get
the hell out of here.

578
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:15,672
You Deaf? I said get the...

579
00:39:21,146 --> 00:39:22,820
Where did you get that?

580
00:39:24,048 --> 00:39:25,555
Oh, my God.

581
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,461
I asked you a question.

582
00:39:32,482 --> 00:39:34,203
Where did you get that?

583
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,305
You're...

584
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:40,188
You're his father.

585
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,219
You're Victor's father.

586
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,578
You're right about the spiderwebs.

587
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,874
What?

588
00:39:55,174 --> 00:39:57,133
The trees with the spiderwebs.

589
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:00,344
Boyd's exact words were,

590
00:40:00,684 --> 00:40:03,734
"They're fuckin' everywhere.
You can't miss 'em."

591
00:40:04,885 --> 00:40:07,154
So, if we haven't seen
any spiderwebs by now,

592
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,578
we're probably headed
in the wrong direction.

593
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,935
So, what do you wanna do?

594
00:40:12,961 --> 00:40:15,172
We should probably get up
to some higher ground,

595
00:40:15,198 --> 00:40:17,242
see if we can't get a lay of the land.

596
00:40:46,206 --> 00:40:47,496
I think it's gone.

597
00:40:59,612 --> 00:41:01,167
We can't do this.

598
00:41:03,315 --> 00:41:04,901
If I die out here,

599
00:41:06,474 --> 00:41:08,581
I'll be leaving my kids with nothing.

600
00:41:10,275 --> 00:41:12,135
There's a reason she went alone.

601
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,745
Because if something goes wrong...

602
00:41:15,854 --> 00:41:18,300
one of us has to be there for the kids.

603
00:41:20,783 --> 00:41:22,034
If she's...

604
00:41:27,506 --> 00:41:29,721
She wouldn't want me out here.

605
00:41:34,022 --> 00:41:35,604
We'll head home

606
00:41:36,701 --> 00:41:38,292
first thing in the morning.

607
00:42:25,196 --> 00:42:26,336
Fuck.

608
00:42:28,688 --> 00:42:29,907
Hey.

609
00:42:30,194 --> 00:42:31,220
Hi.

610
00:42:32,721 --> 00:42:34,478
Want a little hair of the dog?

611
00:42:40,985 --> 00:42:42,753
Oh, you been holding out.

612
00:42:43,575 --> 00:42:45,142
Where'd this come from?

613
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:48,500
Father Khatri buried it in a sack

614
00:42:48,526 --> 00:42:51,169
with a bloody shirt and a candy bar.

615
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,829
What?

616
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,173
It's a long story.

617
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:00,544
You ready to tell me
what's going on with you?

618
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:03,814
Not yet.

619
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:06,220
Still kinda working it out for myself.

620
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,337
But...

621
00:43:08,896 --> 00:43:11,439
I don't think we're doing
very well here, Sheriff.

622
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:14,048
You think...

623
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,705
Is that a...

624
00:43:21,811 --> 00:43:23,345
What the...

625
00:43:26,494 --> 00:43:29,040
No. That... No!

626
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:31,202
- No, no, no!
- What the hell you doing?!

627
00:43:31,228 --> 00:43:33,033
There's goddamn cows in the street!

628
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:35,548
What?!

629
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:38,751
Fuck! Wait!

630
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:44,475
Hi, babe. Hey.

631
00:43:44,501 --> 00:43:46,439
We can't be out here, man.

632
00:43:46,564 --> 00:43:48,760
We gotta get these
things back in the barn.

633
00:43:48,786 --> 00:43:49,929
Come on, baby.

634
00:43:50,642 --> 00:43:52,186
All right. Okay. Come on.

635
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:54,132
Come on, Ginger, good girl.

636
00:43:54,158 --> 00:43:56,530
We'll put up a talisman
if we have to, okay?

637
00:43:56,556 --> 00:43:58,509
Come on. Let's get
them back in the barn.

638
00:43:58,845 --> 00:43:59,993
Come on!

639
00:44:00,027 --> 00:44:01,080
Boyd?

640
00:44:03,205 --> 00:44:06,619
Sheep! Sheep! Boyd! Goats! Fuck!

641
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,580
We have to go now before
the bad things come.

642
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:10,171
- Wait. You have to stay inside!
- What?

643
00:44:10,197 --> 00:44:11,421
- You stay.
- Okay.

644
00:44:11,447 --> 00:44:12,893
Lock the door. Everything be okay.

645
00:44:12,919 --> 00:44:15,626
- We have to go now.
- No! Don't go!

646
00:44:17,784 --> 00:44:18,899
Boyd?

647
00:44:20,345 --> 00:44:21,801
Come on.

648
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:23,921
- Hey, you guys!
- This way.

649
00:44:23,947 --> 00:44:26,788
Get those smaller animals
and take them back inside!

650
00:44:26,814 --> 00:44:29,142
We're gonna take these
cows back to the barn.

651
00:44:29,914 --> 00:44:31,144
Boyd!

652
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,358
Hurry up!

653
00:44:33,533 --> 00:44:36,876
Come on! Come on, come on!
Pick up the pace!

654
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:42,888
Boyd!

655
00:44:43,638 --> 00:44:45,784
- Boyd, look!
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

656
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:46,942
Boyd!

657
00:44:51,701 --> 00:44:52,755
Fuck!

658
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,997
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

659
00:45:00,574 --> 00:45:01,731
Boyd?

660
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:03,802
You just keep coming!

661
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:06,399
This way. Come on. This way.

662
00:45:06,425 --> 00:45:07,536
Come on!

663
00:45:07,648 --> 00:45:09,153
We've gotta get inside.

664
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:15,710
Alma! Alma's outside!

665
00:45:15,736 --> 00:45:17,700
What? Ethan! Hey, no!

666
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:19,526
Hello.

667
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,325
Go! Ethan, run! Go!

668
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:23,528
Julie!

669
00:45:24,365 --> 00:45:25,508
Go!

670
00:45:25,731 --> 00:45:27,146
Go, go, go!

671
00:45:27,172 --> 00:45:29,216
Don't you want to play?

672
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:32,950
I have a surprise for you.

673
00:45:39,387 --> 00:45:40,810
- Go.
- Come on.

674
00:45:41,108 --> 00:45:42,193
Okay...

675
00:46:00,821 --> 00:46:02,364
Okay. Go, go, go.

676
00:46:04,304 --> 00:46:06,260
All right. Okay.

677
00:46:07,165 --> 00:46:08,307
Boyd?

678
00:46:08,997 --> 00:46:10,150
Boyd!

679
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:16,117
Jade, get outta there!

680
00:46:16,143 --> 00:46:17,690
Get the fuck away from me.

681
00:46:17,967 --> 00:46:19,177
No.

682
00:46:25,712 --> 00:46:26,940
Jade!

683
00:46:29,228 --> 00:46:30,454
Let's go!

684
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,511
Go!

685
00:46:48,135 --> 00:46:49,119
Run.

686
00:46:49,145 --> 00:46:51,112
Go, go. Go. Go.

687
00:46:58,205 --> 00:46:59,376
Come on!

688
00:46:59,487 --> 00:47:00,698
Over here!

689
00:47:01,513 --> 00:47:02,658
Come on! Come on!

690
00:47:03,274 --> 00:47:04,557
Go, Ethan!

691
00:47:06,561 --> 00:47:08,080
Go, go, go!

692
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:18,646
Fuck!

693
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:19,945
- Victor!
- Yeah!

694
00:47:19,971 --> 00:47:22,106
Get as many animals into
that barn as you can!

695
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:24,398
We can't stay here! Please! Come on.

696
00:47:25,331 --> 00:47:26,599
We gotta go, okay?

697
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:28,132
Get the door!

698
00:47:28,695 --> 00:47:30,125
Okay. Come on!

699
00:47:30,336 --> 00:47:31,679
- Okay. Okay, okay.
- I got it!

700
00:47:31,704 --> 00:47:33,625
- Go, go, go.
- Come on!

701
00:47:34,968 --> 00:47:36,489
No, no, no! You go back!

702
00:47:36,515 --> 00:47:38,609
No! We do together!

703
00:47:39,124 --> 00:47:40,179
Push!

704
00:47:40,205 --> 00:47:41,375
Come on.

705
00:47:46,468 --> 00:47:48,872
Okay, babe. There we go.

706
00:47:48,898 --> 00:47:50,219
There we go.

707
00:47:50,671 --> 00:47:53,734
- Let's go. - Just pull her all the way in,
Tien-Chen, pull her.

708
00:47:53,778 --> 00:47:57,062
Yeah. Couple more feet.
There you go. You got her?

709
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,828
- Yes.
- Good.

710
00:48:09,381 --> 00:48:10,632
Come on.

711
00:48:11,313 --> 00:48:12,905
Okay. Okay.

712
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:17,328
Right there... Fuck.

713
00:48:18,118 --> 00:48:20,460
You said this place couldn't break you.

714
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:25,132
Do you remember that, Boyd?

715
00:48:25,406 --> 00:48:27,242
"You don't fucking break me."

716
00:48:27,978 --> 00:48:29,703
That's what you said.

717
00:48:32,804 --> 00:48:34,098
No!

718
00:48:34,124 --> 00:48:36,703
- No!
- No! No!

719
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:46,612
No! Let me go!

720
00:48:47,729 --> 00:48:48,940
- Get off of me!
- Boyd!

721
00:48:48,966 --> 00:48:51,112
- Let me go!
- No! No!

722
00:48:51,588 --> 00:48:52,846
Get off me!

723
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,026
Get off of me!

724
00:48:55,245 --> 00:48:58,260
Let her go! Let her go!

725
00:48:58,401 --> 00:49:00,047
Boyd! Boyd!

726
00:49:00,073 --> 00:49:02,206
Get the fuck off me!

727
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:03,924
Let her go!

728
00:49:04,158 --> 00:49:05,964
Motherfuck you!

729
00:49:06,182 --> 00:49:07,867
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

730
00:49:07,893 --> 00:49:10,259
- Boyd!
- Get these fucking things off me!

731
00:49:10,285 --> 00:49:11,594
- Boyd!
- Kill me!

732
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:12,961
But you leave her alone!

733
00:49:12,987 --> 00:49:15,887
We're not gonna kill you, Boyd.
That would be no fun.

734
00:49:16,268 --> 00:49:18,556
You think this place can't break you?

735
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:20,083
Let's see.

736
00:49:25,612 --> 00:49:27,398
No. No, no, no, no, no!

737
00:49:27,424 --> 00:49:28,971
Don't! What the fuck?!

738
00:49:28,997 --> 00:49:30,568
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

739
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,069
No, no! Hey, hey, hey! Look at me!

740
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:34,065
- Boyd!
- I know, I know, I know!

741
00:49:34,131 --> 00:49:35,431
Look at me!

742
00:49:35,831 --> 00:49:37,414
Can... can you say... look! Look!

743
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,410
Open your eyes! Look at me!

744
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:40,589
What?

745
00:49:42,003 --> 00:49:44,510
Okay. Say... say it again!

746
00:49:45,475 --> 00:49:48,393
I know! I know. Look! Come on.
Please don't, don't.

747
00:49:49,674 --> 00:49:50,734
Don't!

748
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,383
Okay! Okay! No! Keep looking at me.

749
00:49:53,409 --> 00:49:56,339
I'm sorry. You're so strong!
You're so strong.

750
00:49:56,365 --> 00:49:57,375
Just...

751
00:49:57,401 --> 00:50:00,320
No, no, no, no, no, no! I know,
I know, I know, I know, I know.

752
00:50:00,346 --> 00:50:02,831
I know! I know! No, God!

753
00:50:03,009 --> 00:50:05,152
I know! Look! Look at me.

754
00:50:05,676 --> 00:50:07,707
No, no, no. Look at me. Look at me.

755
00:50:07,733 --> 00:50:10,690
Look. Keep your eyes on me.
