Previously on From...

3
00:00:10,387 --> 00:00:12,335
You can't keep punishing yourself, Boyd.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,742
She wouldn't have wanted that.

5
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:16,125
And I wish you had the luxury of grief,

6
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:18,741
but you don't. These people need you.

7
00:00:18,746 --> 00:00:21,639
I knew all about the divorce
and how this whole trip

8
00:00:21,644 --> 00:00:22,710
was just one last hurrah

9
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:24,325
before you sat us
down to break the news.

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,609
Thomas is dead! You have two other kids!

11
00:00:27,805 --> 00:00:29,502
Why aren't we enough for you?

12
00:00:33,378 --> 00:00:36,790
Hello? Is anybody out there?

13
00:00:41,831 --> 00:00:44,796
Seriously, man, I don't know why
you keep staring at that thing.

14
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:47,151
Yeah, there's two pages
stuck together here.

15
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:50,587
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16
00:00:55,123 --> 00:00:56,398
Holy shit.

17
00:00:56,403 --> 00:00:59,054
I have Sara tied up
in the basement of the church.

18
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,695
She showed me this.

19
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,968
Something was watching me that day,

20
00:01:02,973 --> 00:01:04,453
the same thing that told Sara...

21
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:06,421
And you think this thing
is trying to help us?

22
00:01:06,426 --> 00:01:09,289
Whatever it is, it's a part
of the fabric of this place.

23
00:01:09,294 --> 00:01:12,377
They're in the house! They're inside!

24
00:01:17,906 --> 00:01:18,960
Follow protocol!

25
00:01:18,965 --> 00:01:20,859
Find your buddy, get into the van!

26
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:22,540
Ellis! We have to get back in the house!

27
00:01:22,544 --> 00:01:25,000
We have to get inside!
I have an idea. Come on!

28
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:29,804
Please, please, please, please!

29
00:01:29,809 --> 00:01:30,809
We have to go.

30
00:01:30,814 --> 00:01:33,390
Go where? Where are we going?

31
00:01:33,395 --> 00:01:35,049
You go first.

32
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:36,554
I'll follow you down.

33
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:38,265
We need to get to town.

34
00:01:39,177 --> 00:01:41,055
No. We have to go to the trees.

35
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,462
- You're crazy.
- You have to get inside.

36
00:01:43,467 --> 00:01:45,524
- The tree? No! No!
- You'll be safe!

37
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:46,688
- What?
- I promise.

38
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:48,293
Find your brother. You have to tell him.

39
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,369
I'll be right behind you!

40
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,735
No! No, come here!

41
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:02,516
Stay with me.

42
00:02:23,897 --> 00:02:25,399
Hey, Sheriff?

43
00:02:25,724 --> 00:02:27,291
Yep.

44
00:02:28,117 --> 00:02:29,712
In a sec.

45
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:38,180
I got, uh...

46
00:02:38,185 --> 00:02:40,306
I got most of the Colony
House residents squared away.

47
00:02:40,365 --> 00:02:42,463
Most people in town aren't
really using their basements,

48
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:44,773
so each house is gonna
take two or three.

49
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:46,923
Some are at the clinic and, uh,

50
00:02:47,562 --> 00:02:49,768
the last three are gonna
stay with me and my mom...

51
00:02:50,227 --> 00:02:51,985
and Jade, I guess.

52
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:54,462
Okay.

53
00:02:54,844 --> 00:02:57,548
Feels like things are starting
to get tense out there.

54
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,142
People are already
boarding up their windows,

55
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:02,001
and with Colony House and
the town living together now,

56
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:04,791
I think maybe we should get
everyone gathered together

57
00:03:04,796 --> 00:03:07,261
and, I don't know, say something?

58
00:03:08,016 --> 00:03:09,402
It's a good idea.

59
00:03:10,172 --> 00:03:11,798
You should do that.

60
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:15,391
I think it would mean a
lot more coming from you.

61
00:03:17,202 --> 00:03:18,508
Right.

62
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:21,066
Right.

63
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:23,548
Are you okay?

64
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:28,195
He saved my life. You know that?

65
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:30,946
Father Khatri, the night
we got into town,

66
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:33,345
he risked his own life
to make sure that...

67
00:03:36,223 --> 00:03:38,423
- Give everyone my regards.
- Wait. Where are you going?

68
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:39,931
I got something to do. It's important.

69
00:03:39,935 --> 00:03:41,762
More important than this?

70
00:03:42,252 --> 00:03:44,751
Sheriff, the people need you right now.

71
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:46,323
- They need to hear that...
- What?

72
00:03:46,482 --> 00:03:48,423
They need to hear what?

73
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:51,207
Everything's gonna be
okay? That God's got a plan.

74
00:03:51,212 --> 00:03:53,339
Look, if you're gonna be
the sheriff when I'm gone,

75
00:03:53,344 --> 00:03:55,267
you're gonna need to start
figuring out how to say things

76
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:58,230
like that for yourself and
sound halfway convincing.

77
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,462
You'll do fine.

78
00:04:24,073 --> 00:04:25,762
Let's take a walk.

79
00:06:42,087 --> 00:06:43,621
? And if I had a boat ?

80
00:06:43,626 --> 00:06:45,779
- Come on!
- ? I'd go out on the ocean ?

81
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:47,462
Listen to those lyrics.

82
00:06:47,828 --> 00:06:50,004
Listen to how peaceful that sounds.

83
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:54,184
The man is riding a pony on an ocean.

84
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,301
You know why? 'Cause he has a boat.

85
00:06:58,306 --> 00:07:00,283
Doesn't matter how many
times you listen to the song,

86
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,115
still can't afford to buy a boat.

87
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,934
Yeah, look, all I'm saying is
if we manage the payments...

88
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:06,949
Oh, we're gonna manage the payments?

89
00:07:06,954 --> 00:07:08,923
- Yeah!
- Right.

90
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,637
So, is not paying the payments
one of the management options?

91
00:07:11,642 --> 00:07:14,259
Because that's the
option we'd be taking.

92
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:16,419
Yeah, I'm pretty sure most
lenders frown on that option.

93
00:07:16,423 --> 00:07:18,197
Yeah, yeah. Listen,
nobody's talking to you.

94
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:20,611
All right? Nobody.

95
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:23,244
You know what they used to
call me in the army, right?

96
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:24,681
Mr. Fish and Loaves.

97
00:07:24,686 --> 00:07:26,603
That's right! That's right!
That's right!

98
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:28,348
They'd send me to any base to set it up,

99
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:30,878
and no matter what they gave
me, no matter what the resources,

100
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,253
I would make it work.
Yes, sir, that's right.

101
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:35,165
Mr. Fish and Loaves.

102
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:37,923
Yeah, but, you know, didn't
they call mom Iron Abby?

103
00:07:37,928 --> 00:07:40,379
They certainly did.
And don't you forget it.

104
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:42,541
Yeah, yeah. I hear you.

105
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:45,892
The problem with iron is... rigid.

106
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:49,564
So, sometimes, you know, it
doesn't know when to bend.

107
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,668
Babe... Babe... all I'm saying,

108
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,790
all I'm saying is, a boat,

109
00:07:56,652 --> 00:07:59,908
you know, wouldn't be
a bad retirement gift.

110
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:01,728
In case you needed some ideas

111
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:04,651
on how to help me, you
know, smooth my transition

112
00:08:04,656 --> 00:08:09,220
from a long and decorated
military career to, you know,

113
00:08:09,225 --> 00:08:11,751
this strange and
mysterious civilian life.

114
00:08:12,684 --> 00:08:14,612
And a boat... Babe, what
are... What are you looking for?

115
00:08:14,616 --> 00:08:17,173
My-my Chapstick. I can't
find anything in this bag.

116
00:08:17,178 --> 00:08:19,040
Can you hold this for me?

117
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:22,126
Sure. What is... Is...

118
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:25,048
This... This looks like a boat key.

119
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:26,486
- What?
- What?

120
00:08:26,491 --> 00:08:28,861
Yeah, why am I holding a-a boat key?

121
00:08:29,837 --> 00:08:31,637
Wait, did you buy the boat?

122
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:33,793
Oh, shit.

123
00:08:33,798 --> 00:08:35,322
Of course we bought you a boat!

124
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,242
- Oh, snap!
- If I had to listen to that man

125
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:38,994
sing about Tonto and
his pony one more time,

126
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:40,740
I'd throw myself into traffic.

127
00:08:40,745 --> 00:08:43,072
- Oh, snap!
- Happy retirement, Dad!

128
00:08:43,077 --> 00:08:45,056
You bought me a boat, baby!

129
00:08:45,061 --> 00:08:46,408
- Thank you!
- Dad!

130
00:08:46,413 --> 00:08:48,285
Oh!

131
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,361
Oh, God.

132
00:09:05,224 --> 00:09:06,829
Please,

133
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,861
can you just tell me where we're going?

134
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:11,520
Where's Father Khatri?

135
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:15,790
They used to shriek. Did you know that?

136
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:20,314
All night long, they'd
shriek. Drove people crazy.

137
00:09:21,596 --> 00:09:24,134
That all stopped once
we got the talismans.

138
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:25,314
Then they started to whisper.

139
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:27,064
I always wondered about that.

140
00:09:28,237 --> 00:09:30,631
Your voices tell you
anything about that?

141
00:09:31,713 --> 00:09:33,236
No.

142
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:36,027
'Course not. God forbid they
tell you anything useful.

143
00:09:37,466 --> 00:09:39,072
Keep walking.

144
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,962
Not until you tell me what's going on.

145
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:43,174
You think you're gonna stand there

146
00:09:43,178 --> 00:09:45,173
and make demands after what you did?

147
00:09:45,178 --> 00:09:46,309
Where is Father Khatri?

148
00:09:46,314 --> 00:09:47,783
He's dead!

149
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:49,901
What?

150
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,525
Those things got into Colony House.

151
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,345
Father Khatri tried
to help. Now he's dead,

152
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,700
along with a lot of other people.

153
00:09:58,066 --> 00:10:00,068
Is Ellis okay?

154
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:05,365
He's fine. He's scraped up.

155
00:10:05,823 --> 00:10:08,228
He's back at the clinic with the others.

156
00:10:09,832 --> 00:10:11,573
Oh, now you wanna cry.

157
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:14,947
You cry like that for Bing Qian?

158
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,908
You think I'm a monster.

159
00:10:16,913 --> 00:10:18,915
I don't give two shits what you are.

160
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,525
The only reason you're alive
is because Father Khatri

161
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,090
thought you could help us all get home.

162
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,009
The second you prove him wrong,

163
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:27,212
I'm gonna put a bullet in you myself.

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,958
Now, keep walking.

165
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,533
- Where are we going?
- I said keep walking!

166
00:10:43,774 --> 00:10:45,876
So, I'll make up some beds
for you in the basement.

167
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:48,954
Uh, bathroom's in the back and
feel free to use the kitchen,

168
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,874
but you've gotta respect the rations.

169
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:52,768
It won't be the most
comfortable thing in the world,

170
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:54,291
but we should have Colony House back up

171
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:55,916
and running pretty soon, so...

172
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,564
What the fuck is this?

173
00:10:57,569 --> 00:11:00,137
Uh, we're gonna have a few more
house guests for a little while.

174
00:11:00,972 --> 00:11:03,915
And how little is a little while?

175
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:07,579
Aren't you the guy that thought
this was a giant escape room?

176
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,087
How'd that work out for you?

177
00:11:09,373 --> 00:11:10,564
- Fuck off.
- Okay.

178
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,181
All right, this is bullshit, okay?

179
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:14,337
They chose the flower.
They don't belong here.

180
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:15,474
Dude, why don't you just...

181
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:17,275
All right, any of you guys know Victor?

182
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,994
All right, where's he
squatting? I need to find him.

183
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:21,845
I saw him running towards the woods

184
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,151
with the Matthews girl last night.

185
00:11:23,155 --> 00:11:25,439
Fantastic. See what
a little intercommunity

186
00:11:25,444 --> 00:11:28,728
cooperation can do? Kumbay-fucking-ya!

187
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:31,994
Let's get inside.

188
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:34,088
That guy's the fuckin' worst.

189
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:36,986
I don't... I don't even understand.

190
00:11:37,211 --> 00:11:39,735
It was like one second everyone
was having such a good time...

191
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,655
How... How did you get out of the house?

192
00:11:43,023 --> 00:11:45,677
I was... I was up in
Victor's room and we...

193
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:47,658
No. It...

194
00:11:47,663 --> 00:11:50,033
- It wasn't like that. We were...
- Julie...

195
00:11:50,038 --> 00:11:51,996
No, he was stacking all of these,

196
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:53,921
and it looked like he was
getting ready to leave.

197
00:11:53,926 --> 00:11:56,298
And then, when the screaming started,

198
00:11:56,303 --> 00:11:58,740
we climbed out his window,

199
00:11:58,745 --> 00:12:00,626
and he said we had to go to the forest.

200
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:02,940
And then, we ran to this tree
and then he pushed me inside...

201
00:12:02,944 --> 00:12:04,869
- Hey.
- And I...

202
00:12:04,874 --> 00:12:06,572
He said it was starting.

203
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:08,735
What was starting?

204
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,830
I don't know. He...

205
00:12:13,413 --> 00:12:15,676
All I know is, one second,
I was in a tree,

206
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:18,783
and the next, I was in
a giant cabinet in a root cellar.

207
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:19,832
How is that possible?

208
00:12:19,837 --> 00:12:22,150
You went through a Farway Tree!

209
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,728
Huh?

210
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:27,823
Victor said you can
go all sorts of places.

211
00:12:28,168 --> 00:12:31,824
And sometimes people
go to different places.

212
00:12:32,048 --> 00:12:34,283
So, maybe he went somewhere else.

213
00:12:34,636 --> 00:12:36,056
We have to find him!

214
00:12:36,061 --> 00:12:38,283
One step at a time. Hey, Julie...

215
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,009
Jules... Hey, Jules.

216
00:12:44,954 --> 00:12:46,390
Julie...

217
00:12:47,262 --> 00:12:50,361
What's happening to us? What...?

218
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,814
- Honey...
- What is going on?

219
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:53,819
What's happening?

220
00:12:53,824 --> 00:12:56,220
We're digging a big
hole in the basement.

221
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:58,853
We're gonna find out where
the electricity comes from.

222
00:12:58,858 --> 00:13:00,611
Hey, hey. No.

223
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,290
Jules, we're gonna be fine. Breathe.

224
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:06,439
I know. Everything's gonna be okay.

225
00:13:06,444 --> 00:13:08,525
- Yes.
- No! How can you say that?

226
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,486
What part of this is okay?

227
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:13,111
Honey, oh my God. Just...

228
00:13:13,116 --> 00:13:15,884
Ah. Good, you're here.
Have you seen Victor?

229
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:17,135
- Hey!
- One of the squatters

230
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:19,463
at my house said you ran off to
the woods with him last night!

231
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:20,949
Ow! Ow!

232
00:13:20,954 --> 00:13:22,439
Hey! I need to talk to her!

233
00:13:22,444 --> 00:13:23,947
What is wrong with you?!

234
00:13:24,496 --> 00:13:26,486
Do you have any idea
what she has been through?

235
00:13:26,491 --> 00:13:28,627
Look, believe me, I get it.
Times are tough all around.

236
00:13:28,631 --> 00:13:30,744
But I found something last night!

237
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:35,824
There is this symbol that
I've been... I've been seeing.

238
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:37,396
The same symbol is in this book.

239
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,750
And last night, okay, last night,

240
00:13:38,755 --> 00:13:40,279
I found this photo!

241
00:13:40,284 --> 00:13:41,717
I don't give a shit about your questions

242
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:44,189
and your symbol and your books.

243
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,525
Just stay the fuck
away from my daughter.

244
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,025
You understand me?

245
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:54,400
Okay, you're doing the
whole protective dad thing.

246
00:13:55,248 --> 00:13:56,989
I respect that.

247
00:13:56,994 --> 00:13:59,439
You dragged me out into the woods,

248
00:13:59,577 --> 00:14:02,802
have me climb a fuckin'
tree for some stupid idea,

249
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:04,678
and then you run off like a psycho

250
00:14:04,683 --> 00:14:06,467
before we even have a chance to try it.

251
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:09,866
Yeah, uh, I'm sorry about that...

252
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:11,844
It worked.

253
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:15,729
- Wait. What?
- Yeah.

254
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:19,751
All I got was some
static, but it worked.

255
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:24,744
I think if we get it
up over the tree line,

256
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:25,881
and we get it enough power,

257
00:14:25,886 --> 00:14:27,626
I think we could get a signal out.

258
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:29,298
Wait, wait, wait.

259
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:31,815
How do you propose we
get up over the tree line?

260
00:14:32,988 --> 00:14:35,126
We start by going to the high ground.

261
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:50,459
Jesus. That's grim.

262
00:14:51,001 --> 00:14:52,279
_

263
00:14:56,873 --> 00:14:58,686
Where are all the people?

264
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:00,171
I mean...

265
00:15:01,028 --> 00:15:02,682
Wait!

266
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:04,602
- Whoa, Boyd!
- Jesus!

267
00:15:05,014 --> 00:15:07,881
Hey! Hey, hey, back up!

268
00:15:08,848 --> 00:15:10,023
Back up!

269
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:12,498
You tryin' to get yourself killed?

270
00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:14,381
I need you to listen to me, please.

271
00:15:14,534 --> 00:15:16,536
Okay? There isn't much time.

272
00:15:16,768 --> 00:15:20,337
Now, this is gonna
sound very, very strange,

273
00:15:20,342 --> 00:15:21,398
and you're not gonna believe me,

274
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:23,568
and I wouldn't believe me either. Okay?

275
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:25,693
And I wish there was
more time to explain.

276
00:15:25,698 --> 00:15:27,576
But if you don't come with me right now,

277
00:15:27,581 --> 00:15:29,850
you're all going to die.

278
00:15:30,057 --> 00:15:32,287
- Oh...
- Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, Mom.

279
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:34,053
Mom, what the hell are you doing?

280
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,016
Okay, you have a gun. That is good.

281
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:39,748
And you're welcome to keep it
pointed at me the entire time.

282
00:15:39,753 --> 00:15:43,539
But I am begging you,
please come with me.

283
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:46,272
Go on. Drive away. Drive away.

284
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:48,600
No, no, no, no. Please.

285
00:15:51,308 --> 00:15:53,217
What the hell was that?

286
00:15:54,101 --> 00:15:56,016
That was death,

287
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,029
and it's coming... right now.

288
00:15:59,987 --> 00:16:01,795
Please.

289
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,404
Let's go.

290
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:28,943
You can put that thing away now.

291
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,866
The only things that are
gonna hurt you are out there,

292
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,882
and that thing's not gonna
make a damn bit of difference

293
00:16:33,886 --> 00:16:35,148
if they find us.

294
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:41,256
Look, I know you all have questions.

295
00:16:42,025 --> 00:16:46,029
And, I promise, we will
talk when the sun comes up.

296
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,014
- Okay.
- Ah...

297
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:05,192
- Here we go, all right?
- Okay.

298
00:17:05,196 --> 00:17:06,756
- Nice and slow.
- Okay.

299
00:17:06,761 --> 00:17:08,116
It's gonna hurt a bit. Just breathe.

300
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,209
- Yeah.
- Good, good, good.

301
00:17:10,214 --> 00:17:11,615
There we go.

302
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,622
Breathe.

303
00:17:12,627 --> 00:17:14,240
Good. Breathe, breathe, breathe.

304
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:16,178
Relax. Down. Good.

305
00:17:16,183 --> 00:17:17,662
Okay, see? Good as new.

306
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:18,667
Yeah.

307
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:20,100
- All right.
- Yeah.

308
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,705
Just gonna put a sling on here.

309
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,529
Can I help with anything?

310
00:17:23,534 --> 00:17:25,662
Make sure he doesn't
get out of bed. Okay?

311
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:26,973
I don't want you going anywhere

312
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:29,225
until I can give you a solid once-over.

313
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,115
- Yeah.
- All right?

314
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,209
Here we go. You good?

315
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,678
Be back in a second, okay?

316
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:37,990
Thank you.

317
00:17:40,436 --> 00:17:42,037
Hey.

318
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:43,295
Busy day for you.

319
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,537
Uh, yeah, we're a little short-handed.

320
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:47,022
What can I do?

321
00:17:47,027 --> 00:17:48,193
Well, I could use some help

322
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:49,577
getting this place a bit more secure.

323
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:51,679
It's gonna be a full house
tonight, given what happened.

324
00:17:51,683 --> 00:17:53,467
- So...
- Yeah, of course.

325
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,691
Oh, I, um...

326
00:17:55,696 --> 00:17:59,443
I, uh... I finished Chapter 6. It's...

327
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:00,913
Things are starting to get interesting.

328
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:02,077
Yeah, I don't think it's gonna be

329
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,287
much of a reading
night tonight, but, uh,

330
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,561
yeah, I'll try to check it out.

331
00:18:05,566 --> 00:18:06,741
Cool.

332
00:18:10,513 --> 00:18:12,341
Thanks, Deputy.

333
00:18:25,969 --> 00:18:27,231
Donna.

334
00:18:37,187 --> 00:18:39,170
You got a minute?

335
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,475
How's Julie?

336
00:18:42,738 --> 00:18:44,717
She's okay.

337
00:18:44,722 --> 00:18:46,158
She's, uh...

338
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,687
But that... That's not why I'm here.

339
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:51,285
We came because we need your help.

340
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,290
With what?

341
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:54,357
We, we...

342
00:18:55,286 --> 00:18:56,592
We wanna build a tower

343
00:18:56,597 --> 00:18:58,061
and we wanna put it on the roof.

344
00:18:58,066 --> 00:18:59,066
What?

345
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:01,412
We think if we can get it high enough,

346
00:19:01,718 --> 00:19:04,397
we could broadcast a signal

347
00:19:04,402 --> 00:19:06,147
that anyone else in the area could hear.

348
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:08,676
And what area is that exactly?

349
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:12,303
Look, whatever this place is,

350
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:15,842
wherever this place is,

351
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:19,387
radio signals work
in ways that we can't.

352
00:19:19,611 --> 00:19:22,310
And we already got a strong
indication that this could work.

353
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:25,589
Well...
Weg ot a little static.

354
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,397
C... Colony House

355
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:31,975
is the highest point
on the highest hill.

356
00:19:32,402 --> 00:19:34,608
And if we build a tower
and we put it up there,

357
00:19:34,613 --> 00:19:36,593
we could broadcast out
a signal that could get up over

358
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:39,311
any interference from the forest canopy.

359
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,451
Sure.

360
00:19:47,822 --> 00:19:49,868
You're okay with this?

361
00:19:50,216 --> 00:19:53,219
You know how many people
died here last night?

362
00:19:54,635 --> 00:19:56,202
Fourteen.

363
00:19:57,485 --> 00:19:59,795
Those things killed 14 of my people.

364
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,529
There are pieces of them
lying all over this hill.

365
00:20:04,781 --> 00:20:08,219
And I don't think the others
are coming back any time soon.

366
00:20:11,097 --> 00:20:13,600
So, we might as well use
the house for something.

367
00:20:17,157 --> 00:20:18,811
Keep going.

368
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:23,748
Wait right there.

369
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:34,545
Let's go.

370
00:20:43,178 --> 00:20:44,745
You're gonna sit tight here.

371
00:20:45,055 --> 00:20:46,920
I'll be back before dark.

372
00:20:47,543 --> 00:20:52,026
I've got a few things in town
to wrap up before we head out.

373
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:53,788
Head out where?

374
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:55,897
Find our way home.

375
00:20:56,649 --> 00:20:58,772
You won't need those.

376
00:20:59,449 --> 00:21:01,592
I'm not going anywhere.

377
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,334
I wanna help.

378
00:21:05,946 --> 00:21:09,318
All I've ever wanted to do is help.

379
00:21:09,323 --> 00:21:11,553
There's nothing to
chain you to here anyway.

380
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:12,975
If you run...

381
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,678
I understand.

382
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:20,841
I'll be back.

383
00:22:00,864 --> 00:22:02,834
My God.

384
00:22:06,172 --> 00:22:07,857
Boyd.

385
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,045
Here. Come on.

386
00:22:26,192 --> 00:22:28,310
Welcome to your worst nightmare.

387
00:22:30,745 --> 00:22:32,268
Look,

388
00:22:32,923 --> 00:22:37,310
it's a... It's a lot to unpack.

389
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:40,599
Just take it slow.

390
00:22:40,604 --> 00:22:42,748
I'll explain more at the diner.

391
00:22:42,981 --> 00:22:44,248
At the what?

392
00:22:45,487 --> 00:22:47,750
The diner. It's, uh...

393
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:49,997
Meet me over there.

394
00:22:53,953 --> 00:22:56,738
Hey. You okay?

395
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,935
No, not really.

396
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:04,818
That's what you people
do every night here?

397
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:07,982
Here? You hide and pray?

398
00:23:08,872 --> 00:23:11,982
Well, there's really
not much else we can do.

399
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:16,209
And you don't know anything
else about this place?

400
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,443
Who built it? How long's it been here?

401
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:22,779
Look, what we know is what you see.

402
00:23:23,521 --> 00:23:25,178
And the people here,

403
00:23:26,442 --> 00:23:30,881
they just... they're just
tryin' to live through the night.

404
00:23:31,231 --> 00:23:33,717
Doesn't give us much
time for anything else.

405
00:23:37,068 --> 00:23:38,990
You gotta start working together.

406
00:23:38,995 --> 00:23:41,215
That's a little easier said than done.

407
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,365
Yeah. Right. So, you start small, right?

408
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,241
Gather your resources,

409
00:23:47,246 --> 00:23:50,467
create a system, making sure
everybody's covered at night.

410
00:23:50,607 --> 00:23:52,873
Nobody hides in the same place twice.

411
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:53,921
You gotta get these people to start

412
00:23:53,925 --> 00:23:56,834
looking out for each other,
taking care of each other,

413
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:00,147
and then, you build from there.

414
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,029
Okay.

415
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:08,498
But where do we start?

416
00:24:10,688 --> 00:24:12,849
All right.

417
00:24:13,173 --> 00:24:15,412
Once we have everything inventoried,

418
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:17,678
we're gonna start rationing it out.

419
00:24:17,683 --> 00:24:20,670
Donna here is in charge of resupply.

420
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:23,076
So, you need anything, you go see her.

421
00:24:23,345 --> 00:24:25,099
Abby is gonna be drawing up a system

422
00:24:25,104 --> 00:24:26,732
for where we spend the nights.

423
00:24:26,737 --> 00:24:28,764
We're gonna start
digging up some new spots,

424
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:31,053
make sure we are constantly rotating.

425
00:24:31,058 --> 00:24:32,670
Let's not make it easy for these things.

426
00:24:32,675 --> 00:24:35,156
Come on. What do you got?

427
00:24:35,785 --> 00:24:37,526
All right.

428
00:24:51,113 --> 00:24:52,984
Hey.

429
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,842
What are you doing?

430
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,117
Are you hungry?

431
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:05,039
No. Not really.

432
00:25:13,085 --> 00:25:15,261
Have you eaten anything?

433
00:25:17,828 --> 00:25:20,271
I don't know. No.

434
00:25:22,128 --> 00:25:24,412
I'm gonna make you some food.

435
00:25:26,298 --> 00:25:28,387
Are you and Dad still getting a divorce?

436
00:25:30,007 --> 00:25:32,060
I, uh...

437
00:25:32,891 --> 00:25:35,787
I really don't have an
answer for you right now.

438
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:37,707
It's a simple question.

439
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,759
It's not that simple, honey.

440
00:25:48,645 --> 00:25:50,690
Hey. Hey.

441
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,756
You said you loved each other.

442
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:59,324
We do.

443
00:26:01,217 --> 00:26:02,943
Then why?

444
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,019
- Is it me?
- No.

445
00:26:05,024 --> 00:26:06,504
Did I do something wrong?

446
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:08,764
Oh, God, no. No, no, no. No.

447
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:11,511
No, honey, you didn't do
anything wrong. Don't...

448
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,673
No.

449
00:26:17,988 --> 00:26:19,381
Listen.

450
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:24,822
There are things that
you'll only understand

451
00:26:24,827 --> 00:26:26,748
when you become a parent.

452
00:26:27,346 --> 00:26:29,904
One of those things...

453
00:26:30,763 --> 00:26:32,896
is that you live for your children.

454
00:26:35,951 --> 00:26:41,631
Your only job is... is to
love them and protect them.

455
00:26:46,652 --> 00:26:48,654
So when Thomas died...

456
00:26:51,645 --> 00:26:53,473
something inside of me broke.

457
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,729
And I have no idea how to fix it.

458
00:27:07,512 --> 00:27:09,644
I keep reliving that day.

459
00:27:12,412 --> 00:27:15,123
It was just such a normal day.

460
00:27:15,932 --> 00:27:18,279
You and Ethan were in the next room.

461
00:27:19,526 --> 00:27:20,962
Your Dad and I were in the kitchen,

462
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:24,101
and Thomas was in his changing
table right between us.

463
00:27:36,624 --> 00:27:38,278
Then the phone rang.

464
00:27:40,886 --> 00:27:41,935
I reached for the diaper

465
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,986
and your father reached
for the phone and...

466
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,310
we just turned for one second...

467
00:27:51,717 --> 00:27:54,111
just one fucking second...

468
00:27:54,555 --> 00:27:56,748
and he rolled off the table.

469
00:28:05,772 --> 00:28:08,360
Your father is the love of my life.

470
00:28:12,517 --> 00:28:14,736
But sometimes I see him and...

471
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,712
I hear that fucking phone ring.

472
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,087
Why didn't you tell me that?

473
00:28:29,262 --> 00:28:31,594
Because no matter how grown up you are,

474
00:28:33,452 --> 00:28:35,907
you're always gonna be my little girl.

475
00:28:39,243 --> 00:28:41,332
So we pretended...

476
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:46,417
yeah, that everything was fine.

477
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:51,339
I think that just made everything worse.

478
00:28:55,377 --> 00:28:57,118
I'm sorry.

479
00:28:58,683 --> 00:29:00,805
I'm sorry, too.

480
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:11,652
Let us in!

481
00:29:15,074 --> 00:29:17,673
There's gonna be trouble if
you don't move outta the way!

482
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:20,231
- Let us in!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

483
00:29:20,235 --> 00:29:21,275
What the hell's going on?!

484
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:24,907
Tom, Eli, what the hell are you doing?

485
00:29:24,912 --> 00:29:27,344
We got people from Colony
House in our houses,

486
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:28,821
using our supplies!

487
00:29:28,826 --> 00:29:30,399
If I gotta choose between me

488
00:29:30,404 --> 00:29:32,494
and some asshole from Colony
House raiding this place,

489
00:29:32,498 --> 00:29:35,329
- then it's gonna be me!
- Nobody's raiding anything!

490
00:29:35,334 --> 00:29:36,713
Well, those things
weren't supposed to be able

491
00:29:36,717 --> 00:29:39,415
to get into Colony House either,
and look how that turned out!

492
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,970
- Exactly.
- Alright. So then, you guys...

493
00:29:40,974 --> 00:29:42,802
You just wanna throw it all away?

494
00:29:42,807 --> 00:29:44,829
Start acting like animals
and make it all worse?

495
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:47,016
Look, we're gonna figure this out.

496
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:49,962
Just... just go home.

497
00:29:50,612 --> 00:29:53,063
Just go home, please.

498
00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:04,284
They... scared.

499
00:30:04,289 --> 00:30:05,756
Yeah.

500
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,735
Those things come out at night.

501
00:30:20,142 --> 00:30:22,954
They walking around in the
forest during the daytime?

502
00:30:23,715 --> 00:30:26,024
Not as far as we can tell.

503
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:29,235
There might be resources out there.

504
00:30:29,656 --> 00:30:31,875
We go scavenging during the daytime,

505
00:30:32,428 --> 00:30:34,219
never know what we might find.

506
00:30:34,224 --> 00:30:37,053
Yeah. Good luck findin' volunteers.

507
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:41,204
Right. We'll work on that part.

508
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:43,727
How long were you in the military?

509
00:30:44,534 --> 00:30:47,219
Uh, almost 30 years.

510
00:30:47,224 --> 00:30:48,290
Hm.

511
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,267
Set up operations in
some of the biggest,

512
00:30:50,272 --> 00:30:52,969
baddest clusterfucks on the planet.

513
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:55,824
And your wife?

514
00:30:56,715 --> 00:30:58,824
Abby was a Marine.

515
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,176
She's the badass in the family.

516
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,856
Yeah.

517
00:31:15,428 --> 00:31:17,199
Mom, you okay?

518
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,785
Yeah.

519
00:31:20,384 --> 00:31:22,517
Yeah, I'm fine. I...

520
00:31:24,027 --> 00:31:26,301
I was just thinking
about this dream I had

521
00:31:26,306 --> 00:31:28,003
when I was a little girl.

522
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,005
I was...

523
00:31:32,716 --> 00:31:35,473
Never mind. We should go help your dad.

524
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:37,219
Lots to do.

525
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,965
Can't go, not now.

526
00:31:46,313 --> 00:31:48,272
Damn near had a riot at the diner.

527
00:31:48,277 --> 00:31:50,441
But this is exactly why
you said you had to go.

528
00:31:50,446 --> 00:31:52,356
Things are coming apart. It's
already starting to happen.

529
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,231
We lost over a dozen people last night.

530
00:31:54,423 --> 00:31:57,746
And we'll lose more if...
if they start to panic.

531
00:31:57,751 --> 00:31:59,512
- At least if you...
- Kenny, enough.

532
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,301
I'll stay until things settle down.

533
00:32:01,306 --> 00:32:03,207
And what if they don't?

534
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:05,394
What if they don't?

535
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:07,002
Am I interrupting?

536
00:32:07,132 --> 00:32:08,473
No, come on in.

537
00:32:08,478 --> 00:32:09,663
Sheriff, please...

538
00:32:09,668 --> 00:32:12,834
Kenny, we're done. Okay?

539
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:14,410
We're not done.

540
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,217
I said, we're not done.

541
00:32:20,803 --> 00:32:22,631
You told me you had to go.

542
00:32:23,105 --> 00:32:25,368
You told me that I had to step up

543
00:32:25,373 --> 00:32:27,566
and be strong while you were gone.

544
00:32:27,893 --> 00:32:29,349
You told me we were running out of time,

545
00:32:29,353 --> 00:32:32,269
and what part of that's changed? Huh?

546
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,497
We've all been sitting
around the last few months,

547
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:36,558
acting like those
talismans were a solution.

548
00:32:36,858 --> 00:32:38,715
Like they made us safe?

549
00:32:39,183 --> 00:32:41,949
Well, guess what. We were never safe.

550
00:32:42,522 --> 00:32:45,215
Those talismans were a Band-Aid,

551
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,657
a... a temporary reprieve.

552
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:51,095
Things were never okay here,

553
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,974
and things are never
going to be okay here.

554
00:32:57,231 --> 00:33:02,323
We need to find a way home

555
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,215
or else every single person here

556
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,574
is gonna end up exactly
like Father Khatri.

557
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:12,912
There are answers out there,

558
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:15,707
and you're going to find them.

559
00:33:16,408 --> 00:33:18,018
And in the meantime,

560
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,704
you need to get over
what happened last night.

561
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:22,055
You need to get your shit together

562
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:24,121
and be the scary hard-ass
that you've always been

563
00:33:24,126 --> 00:33:27,042
because that's who people
need you to be right now.

564
00:33:27,735 --> 00:33:30,566
And if we're not gonna
fight like hell to go home,

565
00:33:30,784 --> 00:33:33,265
then we might as well swallow
a fucking bullet right now.

566
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:37,379
Is that what you want?

567
00:33:51,046 --> 00:33:53,700
I didn't know the little
bastard had that in him.

568
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:57,116
Now, how about you explain

569
00:33:57,121 --> 00:33:59,105
what the fuck he was talking about?

570
00:33:59,643 --> 00:34:01,514
Where exactly are you going?

571
00:34:01,942 --> 00:34:05,293
Let's take a walk.
I'll explain on the way.

572
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:09,223
Come on, man! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

573
00:34:09,228 --> 00:34:11,871
Come on! Help me out a little bit here.

574
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,309
Hey!

575
00:34:13,973 --> 00:34:15,540
Look what I found!

576
00:34:15,545 --> 00:34:18,308
Okay, what? Where... Where did you...?

577
00:34:18,313 --> 00:34:21,387
I... He was about half a
mile out, eating some grass.

578
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,066
There are chickens out there too.

579
00:34:23,071 --> 00:34:24,489
Tomorrow, I'm gonna set up some traps.

580
00:34:24,493 --> 00:34:26,097
There's chickens in the forest?

581
00:34:26,102 --> 00:34:27,147
Yep.

582
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:28,918
Hey, you know what? Grab some people.

583
00:34:28,923 --> 00:34:31,707
We need to start rebuilding
that, uh, pen outside the barn.

584
00:34:31,712 --> 00:34:33,894
- Okay? Hey! Hey!
- Hey.

585
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:35,422
- I found a goat.
- He got a goat.

586
00:34:35,427 --> 00:34:36,776
Yeah, that's great.

587
00:34:37,288 --> 00:34:39,480
Hey, uh, look, I need to talk to you.

588
00:34:39,485 --> 00:34:41,553
All right. Hey, could
you take him off my hands?

589
00:34:41,558 --> 00:34:43,340
- No.
- Yeah, no, you got it. Yeah, yeah.

590
00:34:43,345 --> 00:34:44,739
He's not exactly what
I'd call cooperative,

591
00:34:44,743 --> 00:34:45,848
but just hold the rope.

592
00:34:45,853 --> 00:34:47,035
- Yeah.
- You got it.

593
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,004
- I, uh...
- You believe that?

594
00:34:49,556 --> 00:34:51,395
I knew I was gonna find
something out in those woods.

595
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:53,680
I ain't think it was gonna be
livestock, but I'll take it.

596
00:34:53,685 --> 00:34:54,770
Who knows what else might be...

597
00:34:54,774 --> 00:34:56,210
You need to stop going out there.

598
00:34:56,577 --> 00:34:57,969
What?

599
00:34:57,974 --> 00:35:00,281
It's Mom. She's not doing well. Okay?

600
00:35:00,286 --> 00:35:01,888
I mean, you've been going
out there for weeks now,

601
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,707
and you're not seeing
what's happening here.

602
00:35:03,712 --> 00:35:06,019
I think this place is,
like, starting to get to her.

603
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,676
Okay.

604
00:35:08,971 --> 00:35:12,121
Look, I know you're scared, man.

605
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:16,826
I'm fricking terrified. But
do me a favor. Look around.

606
00:35:17,714 --> 00:35:20,418
The things we are doing are working.

607
00:35:20,722 --> 00:35:22,894
There are things out in
those woods that can help us,

608
00:35:22,899 --> 00:35:26,933
things that might even...
All I know, all I know is that

609
00:35:26,938 --> 00:35:30,348
the second we stop looking for
answers, that's when we lose.

610
00:35:30,353 --> 00:35:32,224
Okay, so, then why don't
we just get someone else

611
00:35:32,228 --> 00:35:34,723
to go and look for a while?
Dad, we need you here.

612
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:36,999
Mom needs you here!

613
00:35:37,777 --> 00:35:40,379
Okay, look, she... she's not...

614
00:35:40,842 --> 00:35:43,884
You know, sometimes, I-I
see her just standing,

615
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:45,841
staring off in the middle
of the road, like she's...

616
00:35:45,845 --> 00:35:49,465
Your mom... Your mom is
as tough as they come.

617
00:35:49,637 --> 00:35:51,753
Iron Abby, remember?

618
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:55,585
Now, I know this is hard, but
this is what we have to do,

619
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:56,839
at least for now.

620
00:35:56,844 --> 00:35:59,535
You're not even listening
to what I'm saying to you!

621
00:35:59,773 --> 00:36:02,515
Look, look, okay, okay.
Look, look. Look, look.

622
00:36:03,005 --> 00:36:05,644
We got about four hours
of daylight left, right?

623
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:08,754
Help your mom get everybody
secured, tucked away.

624
00:36:08,759 --> 00:36:11,574
And when I get home
tonight, we will talk.

625
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,254
I promise.

626
00:36:14,364 --> 00:36:16,366
Dad, please...

627
00:36:16,951 --> 00:36:18,871
just stay.

628
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:22,216
We will talk tonight.

629
00:36:22,567 --> 00:36:23,872
Okay?

630
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:27,509
Go help your mom.

631
00:36:51,483 --> 00:36:53,268
What are you doin' out here?

632
00:36:56,516 --> 00:36:59,198
Well, you belong to someone.

633
00:37:01,269 --> 00:37:03,160
Someone out here maybe?

634
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:09,754
You live out here with someone, buddy?

635
00:37:10,305 --> 00:37:11,574
It's okay.

636
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:13,098
It's okay.

637
00:37:15,412 --> 00:37:17,675
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.

638
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,988
I just wanna get a closer look.

639
00:37:24,017 --> 00:37:25,957
Hey! Hey! Hey!

640
00:37:33,577 --> 00:37:35,318
Hey!

641
00:37:38,762 --> 00:37:40,668
What the...

642
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:46,530
No.

643
00:37:48,257 --> 00:37:50,042
No, no.

644
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,186
Fuck!

645
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:30,462
What?

646
00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:55,185
What the...

647
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:24,064
Luck, not skill.

648
00:40:27,741 --> 00:40:29,894
Sheriff Stevens.

649
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:33,028
Heard you had a rough
go of it last night.

650
00:40:34,561 --> 00:40:37,030
Sorry about Father Khatri.

651
00:40:37,633 --> 00:40:39,635
Oh, I appreciate that.

652
00:40:40,476 --> 00:40:41,913
I, uh...

653
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:46,780
Not sure if you heard,
but I'm setting off today.

654
00:40:47,629 --> 00:40:49,842
Gonna find us a way outta this place.

655
00:40:50,134 --> 00:40:52,273
So, in other words, you're
about to go off into the woods

656
00:40:52,277 --> 00:40:54,342
with no idea what you're looking for.

657
00:40:55,206 --> 00:40:57,557
Because that worked so well last time.

658
00:40:57,562 --> 00:40:58,562
Hey.

659
00:40:58,655 --> 00:41:00,178
Right?

660
00:41:00,183 --> 00:41:02,288
Fatima, would you give us a second?

661
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,121
Yeah, of course.

662
00:41:04,482 --> 00:41:05,787
Thank you.

663
00:41:13,651 --> 00:41:15,600
You wanna be angry with me,

664
00:41:16,764 --> 00:41:18,889
you wanna hate me, that's fine.

665
00:41:20,905 --> 00:41:23,242
But I'm gonna say
a couple things and, uh,

666
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:27,294
and you're gonna listen,
whether you want to or not.

667
00:41:29,147 --> 00:41:30,930
Go ahead.

668
00:41:31,815 --> 00:41:33,295
If something happens to me out there,

669
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,070
if I don't... make it back,

670
00:41:37,754 --> 00:41:41,322
I never want you to
regret what you didn't say.

671
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:45,523
I never want you to feel...

672
00:41:48,392 --> 00:41:51,976
I won't be here to
tell you that it's okay.

673
00:41:53,977 --> 00:41:57,242
So, I'm telling you now.

674
00:41:57,437 --> 00:41:59,812
Man, it's okay.

675
00:42:01,293 --> 00:42:05,341
And that you are my son.

676
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:07,190
Mine.

677
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:10,570
I love you,

678
00:42:11,402 --> 00:42:15,562
and I am proud of the
man that you have become.

679
00:42:17,406 --> 00:42:21,758
And not a single day goes by
when that hasn't been true.

680
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:25,827
Okay?

681
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:31,601
Yeah.

682
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,141
Yeah, it's okay.

683
00:42:34,939 --> 00:42:36,680
Okay.

684
00:42:42,254 --> 00:42:43,908
Okay.

685
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:56,375
How'd that go?

686
00:42:56,999 --> 00:42:59,259
About as well as could be expected.

687
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,134
He'll come 'round.

688
00:43:04,316 --> 00:43:05,709
You really going?

689
00:43:07,511 --> 00:43:08,947
Looks like.

690
00:43:11,638 --> 00:43:15,163
You and me, we've had our
differences, but I just, uh...

691
00:43:16,832 --> 00:43:18,610
Thank you...

692
00:43:19,376 --> 00:43:21,462
for looking after him.

693
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,500
You've done something I couldn't.

694
00:43:23,505 --> 00:43:25,420
You did enough, Boyd.

695
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:28,563
You did more than anyone
should ever have to.

696
00:43:29,904 --> 00:43:32,087
So, you come back, okay?

697
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:35,060
Who the hell else am I gonna argue with?

698
00:43:36,227 --> 00:43:37,950
Sure you'll find someone.

699
00:43:38,338 --> 00:43:39,383
Fuck off.

700
00:43:39,388 --> 00:43:41,129
- What?
- Come on.

701
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,760
Now, get the fuck outta here

702
00:43:44,765 --> 00:43:47,680
before people start
thinking we're friends.

703
00:43:47,685 --> 00:43:48,816
Yes, ma'am.

704
00:43:59,174 --> 00:44:01,916
I'm gonna say something to you
that might make you hate me,

705
00:44:02,156 --> 00:44:04,419
and if it does, that's okay.

706
00:44:06,231 --> 00:44:09,290
What happened wasn't your Dad's fault,

707
00:44:09,866 --> 00:44:12,913
and it wasn't yours. It was this place.

708
00:44:13,467 --> 00:44:17,298
I wasn't here. I may not have
seen it, but I know your Dad.

709
00:44:17,824 --> 00:44:19,728
I know that if there was anything,

710
00:44:19,733 --> 00:44:22,301
anything else he could've
done, he would've done it.

711
00:44:24,768 --> 00:44:27,103
What happened was so awful...

712
00:44:28,641 --> 00:44:32,732
it's almost inconceivable,
and it fills you with rage,

713
00:44:32,737 --> 00:44:34,368
rage that you needed to put somewhere.

714
00:44:34,373 --> 00:44:37,251
And this whole time, your
dad let you put it on him

715
00:44:37,287 --> 00:44:39,782
because that's what parents do.

716
00:44:41,384 --> 00:44:43,290
But did you, for a second,
stop to consider

717
00:44:43,295 --> 00:44:45,478
what that day was like for him,

718
00:44:46,363 --> 00:44:50,932
what he's carried every
second of every day since?

719
00:44:58,052 --> 00:45:00,298
If you don't get up and
go after him right now,

720
00:45:00,303 --> 00:45:03,611
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

721
00:45:37,437 --> 00:45:38,613
What's...

722
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,021
Babe?

723
00:45:44,127 --> 00:45:45,650
Ab?

724
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,604
What's happening, Abs?

725
00:45:51,647 --> 00:45:53,430
What's going on, Abs?

726
00:45:57,919 --> 00:45:59,438
Abs?

727
00:45:59,443 --> 00:46:00,879
Abby?

728
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,603
Oh, God. Oh, God.

729
00:46:04,769 --> 00:46:06,548
Ab...

730
00:46:06,553 --> 00:46:09,915
Please. Please, why are you doing this?

731
00:46:10,052 --> 00:46:11,575
It's okay.

732
00:46:11,807 --> 00:46:15,024
It's not real. It's a nightmare.

733
00:46:15,029 --> 00:46:18,380
The only way for us to go
home is to wake everyone up.

734
00:46:18,814 --> 00:46:21,626
It's okay. You can't die in dreams.

735
00:46:21,631 --> 00:46:23,399
Everything's gonna be okay.

736
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,906
Abby. Abby, stop! Stop!

737
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:27,390
S-s-stop.

738
00:46:27,717 --> 00:46:30,589
No. No.

739
00:46:30,594 --> 00:46:33,431
Hey. Hey. I found something,

740
00:46:33,436 --> 00:46:34,830
s-something I think is gonna help us.

741
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:37,010
You didn't come back before it got dark.

742
00:46:37,143 --> 00:46:38,613
There's no way you could
have survived out there,

743
00:46:38,617 --> 00:46:40,251
not if it was real.

744
00:46:42,009 --> 00:46:43,238
Yeah.

745
00:46:43,243 --> 00:46:47,394
It's time to wake up. It's
time to wake everybody up.

746
00:46:47,399 --> 00:46:49,797
Baby, please.

747
00:46:49,985 --> 00:46:51,282
Baby...

748
00:46:53,814 --> 00:46:55,931
? If I had a boat ?

749
00:46:55,936 --> 00:46:58,545
- ? I'd go out on the ocean ?
- Right! If I had a pony?

750
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:00,329
- Mom! Mom!
- ? If I had a pony ?

751
00:47:00,334 --> 00:47:02,415
- Mom!
- ? I'd ride him... ?

752
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,860
No, no!

753
00:47:56,617 --> 00:47:58,353
Dad?

754
00:48:00,887 --> 00:48:03,446
Ellis, what are you doing out here?

755
00:48:04,407 --> 00:48:05,954
Um...

756
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:10,159
I've been following
you since you left town.

757
00:48:10,344 --> 00:48:12,231
I've been, um...

758
00:48:12,667 --> 00:48:15,563
I've been trying to find the
courage to say something to you.

759
00:48:19,361 --> 00:48:21,062
Look, last night, when, uh,

760
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:22,635
those things got inside of Colony House,

761
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:26,469
Fatima and I, we would've died.

762
00:48:27,902 --> 00:48:30,644
I mean, there was no way that
we could've survived that.

763
00:48:32,861 --> 00:48:36,298
But the one thing that saved us,

764
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,705
that saved her...

765
00:48:41,435 --> 00:48:43,394
was the talisman on the door.

766
00:48:49,999 --> 00:48:54,548
I've just been so angry
for a really long time...

767
00:48:56,972 --> 00:48:59,366
and I, uh...

768
00:49:02,755 --> 00:49:04,322
I didn't know how to...

769
00:49:07,296 --> 00:49:10,342
But, you know, if you
didn't do what you did,

770
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:13,890
if you didn't bring
those talismans back...

771
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,406
It wasn't your fault, Dad.

772
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:28,206
What Mom did, it wasn't...

773
00:49:29,611 --> 00:49:31,569
It wasn't your fault.

774
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:39,092
Look, I'm sorry. Yeah,
I'm so sorry, Dad.

775
00:49:39,097 --> 00:49:41,803
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no, hey. Hey, no.

776
00:49:43,316 --> 00:49:45,569
It's okay. It's all right.

777
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,454
I just... I just didn't
want you to leave

778
00:49:48,459 --> 00:49:49,928
without saying goodbye.

779
00:49:50,183 --> 00:49:51,837
This is not goodbye.

780
00:49:51,842 --> 00:49:54,975
Okay? You hear me? Huh?

781
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,679
This is not goodbye.

782
00:49:57,432 --> 00:49:59,537
- Okay.
- All right.

783
00:50:05,173 --> 00:50:06,842
Hey.

784
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:09,170
What is she doing here?

785
00:50:09,175 --> 00:50:12,761
Look, I need to take her with me. Okay?

786
00:50:12,766 --> 00:50:14,093
Wait, no, you know what she tried to do!

787
00:50:14,097 --> 00:50:15,786
Hey, look, look.
I need to take her with me

788
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:18,511
'cause she might be
helpful for us to find out

789
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,636
what we're looking for out there, okay?

790
00:50:20,641 --> 00:50:23,116
I will explain everything
to you when I get back.

791
00:50:23,121 --> 00:50:24,731
We'll have a long conversation,

792
00:50:24,736 --> 00:50:26,781
hopefully on our way outta this place.

793
00:50:26,786 --> 00:50:30,703
But for now, right now, I just
need you to trust me, okay?

794
00:50:30,803 --> 00:50:32,979
Okay, no one can know she's with me.

795
00:50:33,518 --> 00:50:34,954
Can you do that for me?

796
00:50:34,959 --> 00:50:37,744
Can you trust me?

797
00:50:41,904 --> 00:50:43,645
Just come back.

798
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:45,730
Yes, sir.

799
00:50:46,106 --> 00:50:47,613
All right.

800
00:50:48,229 --> 00:50:50,355
Go on. Go.

801
00:50:51,323 --> 00:50:52,629
I love you.

802
00:50:54,755 --> 00:50:56,366
I love you, too.

803
00:50:56,746 --> 00:50:58,628
Okay.

804
00:51:01,613 --> 00:51:03,311
Yeah.

805
00:51:11,664 --> 00:51:13,753
Look, we're in a tight spot.

806
00:51:14,477 --> 00:51:16,827
No one's gonna pretend otherwise.

807
00:51:17,273 --> 00:51:20,298
But Sheriff Boyd is
risking everything for us

808
00:51:20,303 --> 00:51:21,972
out there in the forest.

809
00:51:22,136 --> 00:51:24,399
The least we can do is...

810
00:51:24,404 --> 00:51:26,978
keep ourselves together while he does.

811
00:51:27,566 --> 00:51:29,496
So that means that we're gonna
do things a little differently

812
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,675
going forwards.

813
00:51:31,102 --> 00:51:33,573
No more Colony House, no more town.

814
00:51:33,979 --> 00:51:36,634
We're a community, so...

815
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,339
we do this together.

816
00:51:40,367 --> 00:51:42,519
All you Colony House folk,

817
00:51:42,524 --> 00:51:45,284
I don't want any of you
being shitty houseguests.

818
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:48,779
Now, we're gonna get the
house put back together,

819
00:51:48,784 --> 00:51:50,251
but first of all,

820
00:51:50,256 --> 00:51:52,824
Jim here has an idea about
a way we might be able to get

821
00:51:52,829 --> 00:51:55,247
a signal to folks back in the world.

822
00:51:55,252 --> 00:51:58,066
So we can either put our energy towards

823
00:51:58,071 --> 00:52:00,256
boarding up a bunch of broken windows,

824
00:52:00,261 --> 00:52:03,172
or we can help build
something that gets us all

825
00:52:03,177 --> 00:52:05,097
out of this shithole.

826
00:52:05,602 --> 00:52:06,872
Jim?

827
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,667
Well, we're gonna need supplies,

828
00:52:14,313 --> 00:52:16,722
anything we can get our hands on.

829
00:52:16,727 --> 00:52:19,972
We're gonna need batteries,
anything with a charge.

830
00:52:20,628 --> 00:52:23,110
But most of all, we're
gonna need people.

831
00:52:23,862 --> 00:52:25,759
The sooner we get this built,

832
00:52:26,196 --> 00:52:28,067
the sooner we can all go home.

833
00:52:34,805 --> 00:52:37,373
Hey. You find him?

834
00:52:38,873 --> 00:52:40,425
Yeah.

835
00:52:41,271 --> 00:52:42,722
You okay?

836
00:52:44,144 --> 00:52:46,121
No.

837
00:53:04,154 --> 00:53:05,365
Can't take any chances.

838
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:21,633
Let's go.

839
