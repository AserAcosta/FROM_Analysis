00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,568
Previously on From...

2
00:00:18,593 --> 00:00:20,097
That's why you wanted a divorce.

3
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:22,941
'Cause it would be easier
for you to cut and run,

4
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:26,642
instead of trying to put
our family back together!

5
00:00:26,771 --> 00:00:28,556
When you're with your wife,

6
00:00:28,582 --> 00:00:31,164
you should shut the fuck up and listen.

7
00:00:31,327 --> 00:00:32,720
What you're doing,

8
00:00:32,746 --> 00:00:35,085
how tight you're holding
on to everything,

9
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,962
you're doing it because you're scared.

10
00:00:37,987 --> 00:00:40,954
Ever since I woke up, something
has been happening to me.

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,467
I hear people screaming.

12
00:00:42,578 --> 00:00:45,730
You're at a threshold. The
hero has to be brave.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,935
Julie! Julie!

14
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:53,812
It was the boy in white.

15
00:00:53,837 --> 00:00:56,322
He was the one that was telling
secrets to Christopher.

16
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,710
Christopher wouldn't
go to the tree, so...

17
00:00:58,736 --> 00:00:59,751
What?

18
00:00:59,777 --> 00:01:02,470
I told my mother what
the Boy in White said.

19
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,559
Help me, Elgin.

20
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,572
I can save all of you.

21
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,275
Is this really where it happens?

22
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,561
We were in the greenhouse.

23
00:01:19,587 --> 00:01:21,444
She was trying to help me.

24
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,799
Oh, Fatima!

25
00:01:22,824 --> 00:01:24,251
I said go!

26
00:01:25,024 --> 00:01:26,931
I couldn't stop.

27
00:01:27,892 --> 00:01:31,775
There is either something
horrible growing inside of her

28
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:34,842
or else this place has
finally broken her mind.

29
00:01:34,868 --> 00:01:39,056
But if you are not gonna
tell everyone, then I am.

30
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:42,033
I'm gonna leave supplies for
you at the shack twice a week.

31
00:01:43,488 --> 00:01:44,854
Fatima!

32
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,807
It's the only place that
the baby will be safe.

33
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,535
- There is no baby.
- Yes, there is.

34
00:01:50,697 --> 00:01:52,162
It's just not yours.

35
00:01:52,187 --> 00:01:53,731
Out of my way!

36
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,736
No! No, no! No! No, no!

37
00:01:57,762 --> 00:01:58,960
Elgin!

38
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:00,893
Help!

39
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:04,432
Fatima!

40
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:06,869
Fatima!

41
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:09,877
Hey, it's getting dark.

42
00:02:09,903 --> 00:02:12,041
I'm not going back to
town without her, Dad.

43
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:14,625
Listen, Ellis, she took the talisman.

44
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:16,491
So what? All right, she
wouldn't just leave.

45
00:02:16,517 --> 00:02:18,119
We don't know that. Maybe she...

46
00:02:18,145 --> 00:02:19,979
Hey, listen to me. Listen to me.

47
00:02:20,037 --> 00:02:22,643
Look, we can come back out
in the morning, okay?

48
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:24,322
No, I'm not leaving her
out here overnight.

49
00:02:24,348 --> 00:02:26,619
What are you gonna do? Huh?
You just gonna...

50
00:02:26,924 --> 00:02:28,080
You just...

51
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:32,049
- What's wrong with your hand?
- Nothing.

52
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:34,033
Let's just...

53
00:02:34,868 --> 00:02:36,689
Let's just...
let's just...

54
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,127
Dad.

55
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:41,846
- What's wrong?
- Okay.

56
00:02:43,432 --> 00:02:44,596
What's wrong?

57
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:47,635
Okay, come here.

58
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:50,689
I got you.

59
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:52,087
Come on.

60
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,276
Yeah.

61
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,690
Watch it.

62
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:09,508
Hey.

63
00:03:12,114 --> 00:03:15,052
I got you some things to help you
get a little more comfortable.

64
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:17,849
Elgin...

65
00:03:18,857 --> 00:03:22,107
please, just let me go.

66
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:24,044
You're not a prisoner here.

67
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,349
I told you, this is for your own good.

68
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:28,802
Hey.

69
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:32,762
I'm trying to protect you.

70
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:34,810
Elgin, listen to me.

71
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:37,014
I saw her.

72
00:03:38,005 --> 00:03:41,153
That thing that's been
speaking to you, I saw her.

73
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,198
What she's saying isn't true.

74
00:03:43,544 --> 00:03:46,818
This thing inside me, it's not good.

75
00:03:47,138 --> 00:03:50,159
It won't do good things. Look
at what happened to Tillie.

76
00:03:50,185 --> 00:03:53,036
That happened because
the baby was scared.

77
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:55,818
- Elgin...
- It was hungry.

78
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:57,724
You weren't feeding it.

79
00:03:58,263 --> 00:04:00,808
Fatima, you have to stop fighting.

80
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:03,877
Hey, hey, hey. You know,
wait, wait, wait.

81
00:04:03,903 --> 00:04:05,815
Fatima, Fatima, Fatima, please.

82
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:08,021
Just listen. Listen. It's okay.

83
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:09,591
It's okay.

84
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:12,638
Just sit.

85
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:21,591
You need to eat. Yes.

86
00:04:21,832 --> 00:04:25,384
The sooner you eat, the
stronger the baby will be,

87
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,247
and before you know it,
we'll be going home.

88
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:30,497
All of us.

89
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:35,247
The baby already helped us once.

90
00:04:35,497 --> 00:04:38,294
The night I found out you were pregnant,

91
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,849
I remembered my dream,

92
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,146
and that helped Boyd save the town.

93
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:46,543
Elgin, no.

94
00:04:46,758 --> 00:04:48,819
It's so hungry, Fatima.

95
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,516
- Just a little.
- No.

96
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:51,708
Please?

97
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:55,825
You helped me so much
since I first got here.

98
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:57,943
- Please let me help you.
- No.

99
00:04:59,434 --> 00:05:01,864
Come on. Just a little bit.

100
00:05:12,797 --> 00:05:13,932
See?

101
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,948
www.subtitulamos.tv

102
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:31,117
Hey, Victor.

103
00:07:31,143 --> 00:07:32,867
I don't want to talk anymore.

104
00:07:32,893 --> 00:07:34,945
I understand this could
be difficult for you.

105
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:37,409
But if what you remember
can help us understand

106
00:07:37,462 --> 00:07:39,088
- what's happening...
- No, it won't!

107
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:42,031
I can't... I can't help you

108
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:44,651
'cause all I did is make things worse.

109
00:07:44,747 --> 00:07:45,979
How?

110
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:48,088
She never would've gone...

111
00:07:48,396 --> 00:07:51,182
if I... if I hadn't...

112
00:07:53,322 --> 00:07:55,506
I don't want to remember anymore!

113
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:57,651
Come on, Victor.

114
00:08:03,007 --> 00:08:05,346
No, I can't help you.
I can't help anyone.

115
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:06,745
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:12,494
What happened just now?

117
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,356
When you touched him?

118
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:16,379
I don't... I don't... I don't know.

119
00:08:16,502 --> 00:08:19,033
Hey, you need to...

120
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:20,967
you need to get out to the clinic.

121
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:22,276
Something happened to
Julie out in the woods.

122
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,319
What?

123
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:24,416
Yeah.

124
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:30,953
Okay, and just look right here.

125
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:32,862
Gonna check your pupils.

126
00:08:33,172 --> 00:08:34,369
Good.

127
00:08:35,237 --> 00:08:36,494
Is she okay?

128
00:08:36,674 --> 00:08:40,069
Well, I don't see any signs
of trauma, so that's good.

129
00:08:40,424 --> 00:08:42,471
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

130
00:08:42,851 --> 00:08:45,643
See? Nothing to worry about, okay?

131
00:08:45,795 --> 00:08:46,937
Here.

132
00:08:46,963 --> 00:08:48,995
- Drink this.
- Thanks.

133
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:52,033
Julie, can you walk me through
again exactly what happened?

134
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,338
There's not much to say.

135
00:08:57,401 --> 00:08:59,086
We got to the ruins,

136
00:08:59,112 --> 00:09:01,745
I walked inside, and then I blacked out.

137
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:04,612
You don't remember anything else?

138
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:08,139
I... I had a really weird dream.

139
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:09,892
That's all.

140
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:15,291
Okay, well, I'd like
to keep you overnight,

141
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:16,914
if that's okay with you.

142
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,252
- Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
- Yeah. Okay.

143
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,393
We'll give you folks some space.

144
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:23,502
Thank you.

145
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:36,729
What were you and Ethan doing out there?

146
00:09:40,155 --> 00:09:42,112
It was stupid. We...

147
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:45,134
I went to the woods
yesterday with Randall

148
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,284
and then, we got to the ruins...

149
00:09:47,415 --> 00:09:48,487
With...

150
00:09:48,815 --> 00:09:50,242
You were out there with Randall?

151
00:09:50,268 --> 00:09:52,823
- Look, Dad, it's not like that.
- Julie?

152
00:09:54,502 --> 00:09:55,586
Hi, Mom.

153
00:09:55,612 --> 00:09:57,823
- What happened? Are you okay?
- Yes. Yeah, I'm fine.

154
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:00,417
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

155
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:02,219
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

156
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:04,268
No. I passed out a little.

157
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,654
- What do you mean, "a little"?
- It's okay.

158
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:23,912
Come on.

159
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,962
Randall, are you in there?

160
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,084
Something I can do for you?

161
00:10:52,722 --> 00:10:55,267
What were you and Julie
doing out in the woods?

162
00:10:55,634 --> 00:10:57,869
What did she say we were
doing in the woods?

163
00:10:58,328 --> 00:10:59,798
I'm asking you.

164
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,283
Look, if this is your version
of the big bad dad routine,

165
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:05,869
I'm not in the fucking mood, all right?

166
00:11:05,895 --> 00:11:09,345
After what happened with you
and Marielle and Julie...

167
00:11:10,555 --> 00:11:12,181
She won't talk about it.

168
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:14,736
And I know she's going
through something that...

169
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:18,494
I cannot understand, but
I figured you might.

170
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,658
I was teaching her how to drive, man.

171
00:11:23,994 --> 00:11:25,157
What?

172
00:11:25,876 --> 00:11:27,523
She said she didn't have
her learner's permit,

173
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:29,572
so we boosted the Colony House van.

174
00:11:31,115 --> 00:11:33,962
I freaked out about something
and we ended up in the woods.

175
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:37,246
And the ruins that you saw?

176
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:40,392
Look, man, I don't mean to be a dick,

177
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:42,783
but I got my own shit
going on, all right?

178
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:46,422
You want me to explain what
happened to us? Well, I can't.

179
00:11:46,751 --> 00:11:48,876
And I don't know about
those fucking ruins,

180
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:51,064
but I told her not to go back out there.

181
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,300
Why?

182
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,587
Because they...

183
00:11:58,288 --> 00:11:59,742
They just felt wrong.

184
00:12:00,493 --> 00:12:01,603
How?

185
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:03,972
They just fucking did, Jim.

186
00:12:04,415 --> 00:12:05,783
That's what I got.

187
00:12:06,514 --> 00:12:07,783
Are we done?

188
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:15,783
You want my advice?

189
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,900
Go get the van and teach
your kid how to drive,

190
00:12:23,818 --> 00:12:26,033
because there is fuck all
you can do about the rest.

191
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,922
None of us are getting
out of here alive.

192
00:12:31,506 --> 00:12:33,111
I don't accept that.

193
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:37,915
It's good for you.

194
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:44,650
All right.

195
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:45,903
Yeah.

196
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:47,323
Take it easy.

197
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,509
I'm fine. I'm fine.

198
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,836
All right, we need to
get you to the clinic.

199
00:12:55,454 --> 00:12:56,884
I said I'm fine.

200
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,072
Sun's going down.

201
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:00,980
I gotta ring that bell.

202
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:03,345
All right.

203
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:07,420
Okay. All right. Dad,
you can barely walk.

204
00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:09,636
All right? You're not fine.
Whatever's going on with you...

205
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,715
I know what's going on with me!

206
00:13:14,858 --> 00:13:15,962
What?

207
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:18,767
Fuck.

208
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,040
Yeah, I've known for a while.

209
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,806
Sit down.

210
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:28,837
Sit down.

211
00:13:29,648 --> 00:13:31,335
Hey, Ellis, Ellis, Ellis.

212
00:13:31,572 --> 00:13:32,790
She took the talisman.

213
00:13:32,816 --> 00:13:36,040
Wherever she is, wherever
she went, she's safe.

214
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:37,978
Okay? Hey.

215
00:13:39,224 --> 00:13:40,336
Sit down.

216
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:42,625
We need to talk.

217
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:46,245
Yeah.

218
00:14:17,195 --> 00:14:18,767
We are here tonight

219
00:14:18,813 --> 00:14:22,384
to celebrate a very special anniversary.

220
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,196
One year ago today...

221
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:28,298
our dear sweet Fatima
came into our lives.

222
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:31,227
Some of you were here then.

223
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:33,595
Many of you arrived since.

224
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,063
But all of you

225
00:14:36,688 --> 00:14:39,852
have come to know her and to love her,

226
00:14:40,116 --> 00:14:41,876
for her kindness,

227
00:14:42,391 --> 00:14:43,923
for her strength,

228
00:14:44,423 --> 00:14:45,470
for her wisdom...

229
00:14:45,496 --> 00:14:46,884
And for her weed!

230
00:14:50,277 --> 00:14:53,782
The green thumb is
definitely a big plus.

231
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:57,321
Our greenhouse never smelled so good.

232
00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:01,876
Seriously, the truth is,

233
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,255
you've made this big old drafty box

234
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:06,149
feel a little bit more like home.

235
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:09,423
Happy anniversary, sweet pea.

236
00:15:18,811 --> 00:15:20,321
The kids asleep?

237
00:15:21,151 --> 00:15:22,188
Yeah.

238
00:15:22,743 --> 00:15:24,626
Ethan finally conked out.

239
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,226
I could have stayed with Julie.

240
00:15:27,438 --> 00:15:29,837
We should've have taken
Ethan back to the house.

241
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:32,485
And miss all the fun? Come on.

242
00:15:33,012 --> 00:15:34,868
Who doesn't like a sleepover?

243
00:15:41,196 --> 00:15:43,492
I haven't been doing a very good job.

244
00:15:44,321 --> 00:15:45,911
Oh, Jim, it's okay. You...

245
00:15:45,936 --> 00:15:47,462
Let me finish.

246
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,173
I know you're trying to
make sense of this place

247
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,048
and what happened.

248
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:05,468
And if there's even a chance that
it could lead us home, then...

249
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:08,306
then I'm in.

250
00:16:10,025 --> 00:16:11,344
All the way.

251
00:16:12,762 --> 00:16:15,532
No more second-guessing,
no more pushing back.

252
00:16:23,136 --> 00:16:25,712
There's something
Julie's not telling us.

253
00:16:26,341 --> 00:16:27,454
I know.

254
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:31,282
How long have you known?

255
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,329
It started just before I went
out into the woods with Sara.

256
00:16:43,173 --> 00:16:44,532
Anyone else know?

257
00:16:45,048 --> 00:16:46,235
Yeah. Kristi.

258
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,454
Kenny.

259
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,329
- I didn't want to worry you.
- You should've told me.

260
00:16:53,785 --> 00:16:55,282
I'm telling you now.

261
00:17:04,126 --> 00:17:05,970
Has that happened before?

262
00:17:07,197 --> 00:17:08,382
Yeah, with your leg.

263
00:17:08,477 --> 00:17:09,524
No.

264
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:14,329
So, it's getting worse.

265
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:16,649
Seems like it, yeah.

266
00:17:18,474 --> 00:17:19,774
There's something...

267
00:17:21,456 --> 00:17:23,056
something else I need to tell you.

268
00:17:25,685 --> 00:17:26,798
What?

269
00:17:31,782 --> 00:17:34,532
When I was in the barn with Tian-Chen...

270
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:38,532
they made me watch.

271
00:17:39,906 --> 00:17:41,243
They made me...

272
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:43,829
watch her die.

273
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:48,149
The whole thing was a set-up to...

274
00:17:48,938 --> 00:17:51,188
They said they wanted to break me.

275
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:55,657
Jesus.

276
00:17:56,822 --> 00:17:59,235
What if this thing with Fatima,

277
00:17:59,758 --> 00:18:01,016
with the baby...

278
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:05,717
No, Dad, this isn't...
this isn't because of you.

279
00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:08,748
But you don't know that. You don't.

280
00:18:08,774 --> 00:18:10,634
We don't know a fucking thing,

281
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,571
and now Tillie is dead,

282
00:18:12,597 --> 00:18:14,829
and Fatima is out there
somewhere, and...

283
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,446
and I'm sitting here
like a fucking gimp.

284
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:22,163
You doing okay in there, Boyd?

285
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:24,306
Fuck.

286
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,537
What'd you say?

287
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,656
Dad, no.

288
00:18:27,681 --> 00:18:29,173
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, no. Stop.

289
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:32,798
You shut your fucking mouth.

290
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:34,585
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- Dad!

291
00:18:34,703 --> 00:18:37,337
- Come on, Dad, just...
- Oh, you want...

292
00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:39,908
- Get away from the fucking window.
- Fuck!

293
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,399
All right, all right. All right.

294
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,051
What?

295
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:27,902
No.

296
00:19:30,494 --> 00:19:32,573
No, stop it! Stop it!

297
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:34,576
No!

298
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:37,182
No, no, no, no, no!

299
00:19:39,587 --> 00:19:42,996
No, stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

300
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,637
Leave me alone!

301
00:19:47,694 --> 00:19:49,285
Leave me alone!

302
00:20:46,308 --> 00:20:47,561
Look at you.

303
00:20:49,678 --> 00:20:52,529
I told you when you started to
eat, things would go faster.

304
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,170
The baby's gonna be here in no time.

305
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,381
You know, you should
probably put this on.

306
00:20:58,521 --> 00:21:00,105
Those aren't going to fit you soon.

307
00:21:00,131 --> 00:21:01,441
I hope it's okay.

308
00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:02,865
I had to go to the main storage.

309
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:05,693
I didn't want to risk
going into your room.

310
00:21:08,873 --> 00:21:10,686
Can you help me get up?

311
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:12,873
Yeah. Of course.

312
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:21,580
No, no! No, Fatima, stop!

313
00:21:21,605 --> 00:21:24,833
Elgin! No, no! Stop! Elgin!

314
00:21:24,975 --> 00:21:29,107
Help! Help! Help!

315
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:31,277
You can't go out there blind.
She could be anywhere.

316
00:21:31,303 --> 00:21:33,061
I'm not gonna find her
just staying here.

317
00:21:33,087 --> 00:21:34,675
Okay, then, we get more people.

318
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:36,514
- Get a search party.
- How?

319
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,277
How? Donna is about to tell the
entire town what Fatima did.

320
00:21:40,303 --> 00:21:43,355
You really think that people are gonna be
lining up to help when they hear about that?

321
00:21:43,381 --> 00:21:44,779
I will talk to Donna.

322
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:47,459
- Okay, great. Let me know how that goes.
- Ellis! Listen!

323
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,295
Sorry.

324
00:21:49,701 --> 00:21:52,592
I didn't mean to interrupt,
but I don't think this can wait.

325
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:55,389
It's okay. What's going on?

326
00:21:55,796 --> 00:21:57,170
Is Fatima okay?

327
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,267
She's missing, isn't she?

328
00:22:02,293 --> 00:22:04,157
What the fuck do you know about that?

329
00:22:04,183 --> 00:22:06,384
- No, what the fuck do you...
- Hey! Hey, hey!

330
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:07,884
That's enough.

331
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:12,053
Back up.

332
00:22:12,535 --> 00:22:13,665
What happened?

333
00:22:15,888 --> 00:22:17,234
It's okay.

334
00:22:20,478 --> 00:22:23,537
I heard the voices last night

335
00:22:23,563 --> 00:22:25,733
for the first time since the ruins.

336
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,962
What'd they say?

337
00:22:28,343 --> 00:22:30,220
That Fatima didn't leave on her own,

338
00:22:30,246 --> 00:22:31,736
that something took her.

339
00:22:31,762 --> 00:22:33,017
Wait. What?

340
00:22:34,907 --> 00:22:37,095
They want you to know that she's close.

341
00:22:37,514 --> 00:22:38,696
She's afraid.

342
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:42,008
They were laughing.

343
00:22:42,438 --> 00:22:44,496
- Why?
- Because...

344
00:22:44,521 --> 00:22:46,688
they know you won't find her in time.

345
00:22:49,277 --> 00:22:51,454
They want you to know
you can't save her.

346
00:22:59,231 --> 00:23:00,559
What the fuck?

347
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:11,705
What the hell is he doing? Jesus Christ.

348
00:23:13,314 --> 00:23:15,929
Victor? Victor! What are you doing?

349
00:23:15,955 --> 00:23:17,603
All these things...

350
00:23:19,172 --> 00:23:22,134
I kept all these things because
I thought they could help!

351
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:25,494
But all they do is hurt!

352
00:23:25,962 --> 00:23:29,124
I want it gone! I want all of it gone!

353
00:23:29,251 --> 00:23:31,126
Victor... Wait, just...

354
00:23:31,152 --> 00:23:33,108
just wait! Hold on a second. Victor!

355
00:23:33,134 --> 00:23:35,297
- Whoa, hey. What's going on?
- Get out of my way.

356
00:23:35,322 --> 00:23:36,506
Not until you calm down.

357
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:39,181
- I said, get out of my way!
- Okay, yeah. Yeah.

358
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:42,697
Victor!

359
00:23:42,806 --> 00:23:44,798
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!
- Hey!

360
00:23:48,275 --> 00:23:49,572
Victor!

361
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:51,884
Victor, what's going on? Hey! What...

362
00:23:52,103 --> 00:23:53,251
- What the hell?
- Victor!

363
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:54,354
Jesus.

364
00:23:54,703 --> 00:23:56,142
Just put that down.

365
00:23:56,993 --> 00:24:00,180
- I'm not gonna hurt anyone.
- Okay, fine.

366
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:01,861
Then put it down.

367
00:24:03,517 --> 00:24:04,701
I need it.

368
00:24:04,726 --> 00:24:06,634
- You're scaring people.
- No.

369
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:08,997
They should be scared.

370
00:24:09,022 --> 00:24:11,083
They're... no one's scared enough.

371
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:13,585
- Victor, please.
- I was...

372
00:24:13,726 --> 00:24:16,969
I was so stupid!

373
00:24:17,268 --> 00:24:19,924
I was so stupid!

374
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,343
Yeah, I'm gonna...

375
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:24,257
Just... let me go, please. Please!

376
00:24:24,283 --> 00:24:26,515
If you tell us what
you need the axe for.

377
00:24:26,977 --> 00:24:29,361
I'm gonna go chop down a tree.

378
00:24:37,697 --> 00:24:39,173
I'm just gonna go back to the house.

379
00:24:39,293 --> 00:24:42,270
No, come on. You need to
eat something. Come on.

380
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,358
Hey, guys.

381
00:24:45,114 --> 00:24:47,286
Nice to see the place
up and running again.

382
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,364
I had a little help.

383
00:24:49,642 --> 00:24:52,816
This guy helped a lot with the
cleaning and the reorganizing.

384
00:24:52,842 --> 00:24:55,457
You know, any time you wanna
come and lend a hand,

385
00:24:55,483 --> 00:24:57,017
I could always use a helper.

386
00:24:57,043 --> 00:24:58,473
Well, you hear that?

387
00:25:00,284 --> 00:25:02,452
You know, Kenny was really supportive.

388
00:25:03,442 --> 00:25:04,872
I think it was hard for him

389
00:25:04,898 --> 00:25:07,036
to see this place empty all the time.

390
00:25:07,356 --> 00:25:09,424
And after what happened to Tillie,

391
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,637
I think people need a
place that feels normal.

392
00:25:11,663 --> 00:25:13,583
- Yeah.
- Yeah, of course.

393
00:25:13,786 --> 00:25:15,450
Did they find who did it to her?

394
00:25:15,856 --> 00:25:17,083
Not yet.

395
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:19,721
Just... eat.

396
00:25:19,747 --> 00:25:21,088
- Yeah.
- Grab something.

397
00:25:21,114 --> 00:25:23,028
- I'll get us a couple of plates.
- Yeah.

398
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:30,700
Busy.

399
00:25:32,053 --> 00:25:33,504
It's Boyd.

400
00:25:36,158 --> 00:25:37,278
Come in.

401
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:43,520
Look, look, I know you're upset with me,

402
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,869
- but there's something that...
- I'm not gonna say anything...

403
00:25:47,315 --> 00:25:49,260
about what Fatima did

404
00:25:50,643 --> 00:25:53,018
because of what she
means to people here...

405
00:25:53,322 --> 00:25:56,135
her spirit, her light.

406
00:25:57,581 --> 00:25:59,690
I don't think people could take it.

407
00:26:02,582 --> 00:26:04,565
I don't think I can take it.

408
00:26:06,578 --> 00:26:07,746
She's gone.

409
00:26:09,275 --> 00:26:10,369
What?

410
00:26:11,682 --> 00:26:14,690
I had her in that shed
just outside of town.

411
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,385
Ellis and I went there last night

412
00:26:18,213 --> 00:26:19,557
and she was gone.

413
00:26:19,987 --> 00:26:21,182
She left?

414
00:26:22,721 --> 00:26:25,283
Those voices that Sara hears?

415
00:26:25,854 --> 00:26:27,885
They said something took her.

416
00:26:28,424 --> 00:26:30,143
That she's close by,

417
00:26:30,281 --> 00:26:33,119
but we won't be able to save
her before it's too late.

418
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:35,729
She said the voices were laughing.

419
00:26:37,656 --> 00:26:39,338
Fuck this place.

420
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,112
Ring the bell. We'll call a meeting.

421
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:52,240
What can I get you?

422
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:54,185
What? You don't like your food?

423
00:26:54,556 --> 00:26:57,101
I miss Tian-Chen's pancakes.

424
00:26:58,276 --> 00:27:01,075
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm going to the bathroom.

425
00:27:05,162 --> 00:27:08,263
He thinks it's his fault,
what happened to me.

426
00:27:08,715 --> 00:27:09,919
Why would he?

427
00:27:10,325 --> 00:27:12,055
Because I asked him what I should do,

428
00:27:12,513 --> 00:27:14,341
if I should go inside the ruins or not.

429
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,893
I know it was stupid. I just...

430
00:27:18,496 --> 00:27:22,365
it felt so much like one of those
stories he always used to tell us,

431
00:27:23,232 --> 00:27:26,052
and I was afraid, and I
didn't know who else to ask.

432
00:27:26,386 --> 00:27:28,982
And no offense, but this whole
"perfect family breakfast" thing,

433
00:27:29,008 --> 00:27:30,990
I know what you're trying
to do, but it's...

434
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:32,396
it's not making anything better.

435
00:27:32,422 --> 00:27:34,007
It's just making everything worse.

436
00:27:38,277 --> 00:27:39,377
Everybody!

437
00:27:39,403 --> 00:27:40,888
- Come on.
- Come on!

438
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:44,544
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

439
00:27:49,243 --> 00:27:51,553
We're gonna need everyone
to come outside a minute.

440
00:27:51,578 --> 00:27:53,875
Come on. Let's go.

441
00:27:53,901 --> 00:27:55,235
- Mom?
- Come on.

442
00:27:55,261 --> 00:27:56,610
- What's happening?
- You guys go.

443
00:27:56,635 --> 00:27:58,464
- I'll wait for Ethan.
- Okay.

444
00:28:02,107 --> 00:28:03,808
Fill in. Over here.

445
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,738
Dad, what are you doing?

446
00:28:10,213 --> 00:28:11,311
It's okay.

447
00:28:12,195 --> 00:28:13,401
We're okay.

448
00:28:20,821 --> 00:28:22,087
Come on over.

449
00:28:24,126 --> 00:28:26,587
All right, everyone, listen up.

450
00:28:26,613 --> 00:28:28,680
What happened to Tillie,

451
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,072
we know you're all scared.

452
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:33,354
We know you want answers.

453
00:28:33,497 --> 00:28:34,994
I want answers too.

454
00:28:35,622 --> 00:28:37,444
But right now, we don't have them.

455
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,933
What's going on?

456
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:41,936
- We called you all here because...
- Come on. Everybody's outside.

457
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:44,697
Look, we need your help.

458
00:28:46,216 --> 00:28:47,275
That's...

459
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:49,001
Hey.

460
00:28:50,591 --> 00:28:52,330
Fatima is missing.

461
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,423
- What?
- Fatima's missing?

462
00:28:54,907 --> 00:28:56,414
Nobody's...

463
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:59,103
nobody's seen her since last night.

464
00:29:00,634 --> 00:29:03,166
What we're asking for is a search party.

465
00:29:03,191 --> 00:29:06,628
People to scour the town, every corner,

466
00:29:06,653 --> 00:29:09,046
every crack, so we can bring her home.

467
00:29:09,072 --> 00:29:12,103
Whatever took her, is
that what killed Tillie?

468
00:29:12,387 --> 00:29:13,611
We don't know.

469
00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:17,744
Look, I don't have all the
information on what happened.

470
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:20,439
All I know is that she's close by.

471
00:29:20,518 --> 00:29:21,759
How do you know that?

472
00:29:26,994 --> 00:29:29,369
I know that because
something here told us,

473
00:29:29,891 --> 00:29:31,735
something that wants us to know

474
00:29:31,761 --> 00:29:34,595
that she's alone, that she's afraid.

475
00:29:35,392 --> 00:29:37,826
Something that thinks that
we don't have what it takes

476
00:29:37,968 --> 00:29:39,353
to find her.

477
00:29:39,572 --> 00:29:41,746
Now, look, I can't tell
anybody what to do.

478
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,970
Right? But...

479
00:29:43,892 --> 00:29:45,196
you see these here?

480
00:29:46,303 --> 00:29:47,797
We didn't always have these.

481
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,033
When I first got here,

482
00:29:50,408 --> 00:29:51,798
those things in the woods,

483
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:52,916
they would come out at night

484
00:29:52,942 --> 00:29:55,525
and they would take whoever
the fuck they wanted.

485
00:29:55,975 --> 00:29:58,376
Everybody here was living day to day,

486
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,900
moment to moment, hour to hour.

487
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:02,337
We found these.

488
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:06,688
We proved that this place
couldn't break us.

489
00:30:07,298 --> 00:30:09,749
Now it's trying to break us again.

490
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:14,028
So you can either lay down and die or...

491
00:30:14,209 --> 00:30:16,134
we can say fuck you.

492
00:30:17,093 --> 00:30:18,525
Fuck you!

493
00:30:20,384 --> 00:30:22,469
We are taking our lives back!

494
00:30:23,814 --> 00:30:26,728
It's possible to fight back!

495
00:30:27,552 --> 00:30:29,362
We proved it once before

496
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:31,486
and I am asking for your help

497
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,587
to prove it again.

498
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:35,985
Now, look, it's your choice.

499
00:30:36,237 --> 00:30:38,025
There's no shame in backing out.

500
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:40,081
Okay?

501
00:30:40,497 --> 00:30:42,166
How are we gonna do this?

502
00:30:42,905 --> 00:30:43,939
Great.

503
00:30:44,485 --> 00:30:45,865
We're gonna...

504
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:49,240
We're gonna pair up.

505
00:30:50,288 --> 00:30:52,602
We're all gonna go out
there in groups of two,

506
00:30:52,962 --> 00:30:57,680
and we're gonna cover every
inch of this place, okay?

507
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,892
Okay.

508
00:31:01,834 --> 00:31:04,009
Okay. Let's do it. Let's go.

509
00:31:06,591 --> 00:31:09,071
I have to help. Fatima's my friend.

510
00:31:09,391 --> 00:31:10,810
I wanna help too.

511
00:31:12,112 --> 00:31:13,600
All right. I'll take Ethan.

512
00:31:13,626 --> 00:31:15,089
- Okay.
- You take Julie.

513
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:16,944
We'll cover more ground that way.

514
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,596
Yeah. Okay.

515
00:31:18,622 --> 00:31:19,833
Be careful.

516
00:31:20,538 --> 00:31:22,837
You too. Come on.

517
00:31:23,706 --> 00:31:24,806
Ellis.

518
00:31:26,489 --> 00:31:27,525
Hey.

519
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:31,244
There are gonna be a lot of questions.

520
00:31:31,776 --> 00:31:33,517
Best if one of us finds her.

521
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:36,905
We've got a better chance
by splitting up. Okay?

522
00:31:36,931 --> 00:31:37,946
Okay.

523
00:31:38,345 --> 00:31:39,391
Hey.

524
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,415
We are going to find her.

525
00:31:42,721 --> 00:31:43,845
Yeah.

526
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:45,861
Kenny!

527
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:51,455
- Yeah. - Hey, you mind
coming out there with me?

528
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:54,048
Yeah, of course.

529
00:31:54,236 --> 00:31:55,642
- Great.
- Okay.

530
00:31:55,845 --> 00:31:56,955
Let's go.

531
00:31:58,628 --> 00:31:59,798
Ellis.

532
00:32:00,855 --> 00:32:02,447
You need someone to search with?

533
00:32:03,497 --> 00:32:05,119
Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

534
00:32:05,427 --> 00:32:06,962
Anything I can do to help.

535
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,049
Fatima! Can you hear me?!

536
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,223
I don't understand what
we're doing out here.

537
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:25,808
No one's forcing you to help.

538
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:28,264
- You wanna go back to Colony House...
- That's not what I...

539
00:33:28,655 --> 00:33:31,637
Look, Boyd said that something told
you guys that she was out here.

540
00:33:31,663 --> 00:33:34,395
- What does that even mean?
- That part came from Sara.

541
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,968
Fatima!

542
00:33:35,994 --> 00:33:38,194
Sara? The girl who murdered people.

543
00:33:38,694 --> 00:33:40,270
She's connected to this place

544
00:33:40,296 --> 00:33:42,124
in ways that are hard to understand.

545
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,241
So, you're just gonna
take her word for it?

546
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:46,140
What if Sara killed Tillie and Fatima

547
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:47,858
and then just made up some bullshit

548
00:33:47,884 --> 00:33:50,285
about Fatima being held captive
in the woods somewhere?

549
00:33:50,311 --> 00:33:51,835
That's not what happened.

550
00:33:52,374 --> 00:33:53,585
How do you know?

551
00:33:53,775 --> 00:33:55,140
I just do.

552
00:33:56,155 --> 00:33:59,668
Okay. So, then, why
wouldn't this magical voice

553
00:33:59,694 --> 00:34:01,562
just tell Sara where Fatima is?

554
00:34:01,588 --> 00:34:03,565
Better yet, why not tell
her who killed Tillie?

555
00:34:03,749 --> 00:34:05,241
That's not the way it works, okay?

556
00:34:05,267 --> 00:34:07,655
So, then, tell me how it fucking works.

557
00:34:08,007 --> 00:34:09,516
You know something.

558
00:34:09,765 --> 00:34:11,683
You know something that
you're not telling me.

559
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:13,718
I don't understand you people.

560
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,366
I'm a good cop.

561
00:34:15,702 --> 00:34:18,030
I can be an asset here, if you just...

562
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,367
If I what? If I walk you through
the many different ways

563
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:22,819
this place will fuck with your head?

564
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:28,047
I don't have time for a
goddamn tutorial, okay?

565
00:34:28,189 --> 00:34:31,585
Fatima is out there.
We need to find her.

566
00:34:33,146 --> 00:34:36,124
Because of what she means
to the people of this town.

567
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:40,608
Because of what she means to me.

568
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:44,799
If you want me to believe that
you are good at your job,

569
00:34:44,824 --> 00:34:46,655
I need you to trust me.

570
00:34:47,144 --> 00:34:48,912
I need you to help me.

571
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,928
Can you do that?

572
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:54,881
Yeah.

573
00:34:55,157 --> 00:34:56,233
Good.

574
00:34:57,073 --> 00:35:00,030
When this is over, we'll talk, okay?

575
00:35:01,523 --> 00:35:02,567
Okay.

576
00:35:02,693 --> 00:35:04,014
Fatima!

577
00:35:05,515 --> 00:35:06,788
Fatima!

578
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,804
Hey, so, you're up at
Colony House now, huh?

579
00:35:12,393 --> 00:35:13,507
Yep.

580
00:35:14,952 --> 00:35:18,499
I been meaning to come up there
and look in on you. I just...

581
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:21,085
It's fine. You've got...

582
00:35:21,898 --> 00:35:24,187
You got bigger things to
worry about right now.

583
00:35:24,447 --> 00:35:26,780
Yeah, always are bigger things.

584
00:35:26,806 --> 00:35:27,809
Yeah.

585
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:29,046
Hey, Kenny.

586
00:35:29,851 --> 00:35:33,585
Look, I realize, you and me...

587
00:35:34,835 --> 00:35:36,562
things are never gonna
be the same again.

588
00:35:36,588 --> 00:35:38,185
- Boyd, we don't have to...
- No, I...

589
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,349
I lied to you about what Sara did,

590
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:42,356
about your Dad, and I know
there's a part of you

591
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,191
that's never gonna forgive me.

592
00:35:44,217 --> 00:35:46,622
Being in charge of this
place, it comes with a...

593
00:35:47,357 --> 00:35:50,286
whole mess of decisions you
never really want to make.

594
00:35:51,141 --> 00:35:52,925
But people live and die here

595
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:55,302
based on your ability to
make those decisions.

596
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:57,732
What are you doing?

597
00:35:58,841 --> 00:36:00,278
It's getting worse.

598
00:36:00,802 --> 00:36:02,109
Parkinson's.

599
00:36:02,738 --> 00:36:04,701
Yesterday my leg froze. I almost...

600
00:36:04,892 --> 00:36:06,396
couldn't stand.

601
00:36:07,044 --> 00:36:08,716
- Jesus, I...
- Look.

602
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:11,490
I'm not saying it's today, okay?

603
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,224
Or tomorrow or a month from now.

604
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,919
But I got a clock ticking on me.

605
00:36:17,568 --> 00:36:20,102
Yesterday, that clock started
ticking a little faster.

606
00:36:20,403 --> 00:36:21,481
So...

607
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:23,313
I need to know that, when I'm gone...

608
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:24,615
- No, I'm not...
- Look!

609
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,201
I need to know that when I'm gone

610
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:29,529
or when I'm too goddamn
feeble to do anything,

611
00:36:30,442 --> 00:36:32,841
I need to know that
you are gonna step up

612
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,966
and look after this place.

613
00:36:37,734 --> 00:36:39,938
It has to be you wearing this badge

614
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,810
and not some hothead like Acosta

615
00:36:41,836 --> 00:36:43,992
or anybody else who might
come through here.

616
00:36:44,383 --> 00:36:45,445
You.

617
00:36:46,134 --> 00:36:48,079
I need to know that my family

618
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,149
is in good hands.

619
00:36:51,806 --> 00:36:53,469
I'm not taking your badge.

620
00:36:53,494 --> 00:36:54,512
Kenny...

621
00:36:54,537 --> 00:36:55,634
But...

622
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,853
if you're still looking for a deputy,

623
00:36:59,872 --> 00:37:01,235
I'll take that one back.

624
00:37:03,204 --> 00:37:04,283
Okay?

625
00:37:05,213 --> 00:37:06,344
Yeah?

626
00:37:07,821 --> 00:37:08,825
Yeah.

627
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,657
Come on. Let's keep looking.

628
00:37:12,328 --> 00:37:13,644
Fatima!

629
00:37:32,298 --> 00:37:33,660
Okay. Here we go.

630
00:37:44,284 --> 00:37:46,171
What the fuck do you want, huh?

631
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,585
You think at this point, I haven't
seen enough of you people?

632
00:37:51,108 --> 00:37:54,101
Try something new 'cause this... this,

633
00:37:54,766 --> 00:37:56,350
it's not doing it for me anymore.

634
00:37:58,982 --> 00:38:01,522
You okay? Who are you talking to?

635
00:38:01,548 --> 00:38:02,608
Nobody.

636
00:38:02,634 --> 00:38:05,106
Well, let me rephrase that:

637
00:38:05,132 --> 00:38:07,137
who did you think you were talking to?

638
00:38:07,163 --> 00:38:09,397
Henry, I'm busy. All right?
What do you want?

639
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,463
You did this?

640
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:13,616
I did, yeah.

641
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:16,757
My wife made one of these in our yard.

642
00:38:17,481 --> 00:38:19,171
So you keep telling me.

643
00:38:19,413 --> 00:38:20,468
What's it for?

644
00:38:20,494 --> 00:38:23,138
I don't know, okay? I
thought it might help.

645
00:38:23,542 --> 00:38:26,254
Help figure out those numbers, you mean?

646
00:38:27,714 --> 00:38:29,758
Is there something I can help you with?

647
00:38:30,529 --> 00:38:33,741
Most of the town's out
looking for that girl.

648
00:38:34,641 --> 00:38:35,834
What?

649
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,532
The sheriff's daughter-in-law.

650
00:38:38,557 --> 00:38:40,451
We had a whole meeting about it.

651
00:38:40,476 --> 00:38:41,983
Didn't you hear the bell?

652
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:45,171
Yeah, I just, I'm...

653
00:38:45,815 --> 00:38:47,708
You were busy.

654
00:38:47,865 --> 00:38:49,272
Right, yeah.

655
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,798
You wanna come help me look?

656
00:38:53,823 --> 00:38:55,753
- Listen, I...
- I was hoping we could talk

657
00:38:55,779 --> 00:38:57,280
about Victor.

658
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,940
Stop!

659
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:24,424
You can't do that.

660
00:39:26,065 --> 00:39:28,995
It's a bad tree. It does bad things.

661
00:39:29,924 --> 00:39:31,237
It's important.

662
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,524
Why?

663
00:39:33,534 --> 00:39:35,385
Why is it important?

664
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,426
Why... why won't you help us?!

665
00:39:38,598 --> 00:39:40,041
Because I tried.

666
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,213
With Christopher.

667
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:45,766
I think you need to
learn for yourselves.

668
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:47,836
It's the only way you'll understand.

669
00:39:52,914 --> 00:39:54,721
You look different now.

670
00:39:55,702 --> 00:39:56,940
So do you.

671
00:39:59,034 --> 00:40:00,927
All those years, you looked the same.

672
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:03,174
Why are you changing now?

673
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,695
Everything's changing now.

674
00:40:09,823 --> 00:40:11,120
Is that bad?

675
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:15,221
'Cause I don't know what to do.

676
00:40:16,393 --> 00:40:17,510
You tell me...

677
00:40:17,698 --> 00:40:19,701
You tell me how I can help them.

678
00:40:22,034 --> 00:40:23,182
Please.

679
00:40:25,895 --> 00:40:28,260
You're supposed to be my friend.

680
00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:30,167
I am your friend.

681
00:40:30,503 --> 00:40:31,901
Then help me.

682
00:40:32,505 --> 00:40:36,049
Please? Please help me.
Just tell me what to do.

683
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:38,880
Don't cut down that tree.

684
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:43,180
Where are you going?

685
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:44,782
No, come back!

686
00:40:45,512 --> 00:40:46,953
Come back!

687
00:40:49,235 --> 00:40:50,531
Where are you going?

688
00:40:52,301 --> 00:40:54,586
You know, when I was little,

689
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:57,305
a friend of mine went missing.

690
00:40:57,331 --> 00:40:58,695
You wanna talk about panic?

691
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,820
We had the whole neighborhood
out looking for him.

692
00:41:01,727 --> 00:41:04,258
Grandma said not to worry,
but I was so scared.

693
00:41:04,537 --> 00:41:06,852
Turns out he's on a playground
on the other side of town,

694
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:09,867
having the time of his life.
Everyone was scared for nothing.

695
00:41:09,893 --> 00:41:11,602
Is that what you think this is?

696
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:13,741
Everybody's scared for nothing?

697
00:41:15,086 --> 00:41:16,172
No.

698
00:41:17,399 --> 00:41:18,526
I just...

699
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:21,568
I think sometimes we think the worst

700
00:41:21,594 --> 00:41:22,906
when we really don't know.

701
00:41:22,932 --> 00:41:25,195
Okay, well, what we do know
is that my wife is missing.

702
00:41:25,766 --> 00:41:28,859
All right, no offense. We're not looking
for some fucking kid on a playground.

703
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:32,000
I already lost my mom.

704
00:41:34,479 --> 00:41:36,242
If something happens to Fatima...

705
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,188
Your mom was here?

706
00:41:44,578 --> 00:41:45,930
Look, when she died...

707
00:41:48,382 --> 00:41:49,844
the way she died...

708
00:41:53,234 --> 00:41:54,727
I can't go through that again.

709
00:41:58,008 --> 00:41:59,195
I won't.

710
00:42:11,177 --> 00:42:12,748
You think she could be in there?

711
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,443
Well, you never know.

712
00:42:16,302 --> 00:42:18,068
Best to check everywhere.

713
00:42:20,459 --> 00:42:24,561
Besides, I think this'll
be a good place to talk.

714
00:42:25,536 --> 00:42:26,889
About what?

715
00:42:30,404 --> 00:42:31,693
Come on inside.

716
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:42,077
What happened to the window?

717
00:42:42,592 --> 00:42:45,693
Well, we had a bit of a close
call not too long ago.

718
00:42:46,506 --> 00:42:48,390
Doesn't look like Fatima's in here.

719
00:42:48,416 --> 00:42:49,607
I know.

720
00:42:50,946 --> 00:42:52,654
Last time you were in here,

721
00:42:52,895 --> 00:42:54,592
you were in pretty bad shape.

722
00:42:57,554 --> 00:43:00,072
And all I remember thinking
was, "It's my fault."

723
00:43:00,381 --> 00:43:02,576
"I was the one who was driving."

724
00:43:02,988 --> 00:43:05,615
"I was the one who didn't
see the other car coming."

725
00:43:05,866 --> 00:43:07,928
I just kept thinking we
were gonna lose you,

726
00:43:07,954 --> 00:43:10,584
right then and there,
just like we lost Thomas.

727
00:43:12,126 --> 00:43:14,467
And I never would have forgiven myself.

728
00:43:16,022 --> 00:43:17,607
But it wasn't your fault.

729
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:19,045
No?

730
00:43:19,582 --> 00:43:20,693
Why not?

731
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:22,670
Well, because you were scared

732
00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:25,022
and you were doing the best you could.

733
00:43:26,763 --> 00:43:30,217
Kinda like you were when you told
Julie to go into those ruins?

734
00:43:31,131 --> 00:43:33,342
You were doing the
best you could, right?

735
00:43:34,299 --> 00:43:35,725
I guess.

736
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,529
Listen to me.

737
00:43:42,891 --> 00:43:44,394
Things happen here,

738
00:43:45,006 --> 00:43:46,777
things we can't control.

739
00:43:46,802 --> 00:43:51,654
This place wants us to blame ourselves.

740
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:54,103
It wants us to be scared.

741
00:43:54,834 --> 00:43:57,412
You have to remember that
we're all doing our best,

742
00:43:57,543 --> 00:43:59,350
even when bad things happen,

743
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,997
especially when bad things happen.

744
00:44:03,158 --> 00:44:06,873
Because how we face those
things, that's what matters.

745
00:44:07,386 --> 00:44:08,928
Not the decisions we make

746
00:44:08,954 --> 00:44:12,139
or whose fault it was, but how
we take care of each other

747
00:44:12,165 --> 00:44:14,881
and how we always do our
best, no matter what.

748
00:44:15,102 --> 00:44:16,443
You understand?

749
00:44:18,995 --> 00:44:20,366
I love you, buddy.

750
00:44:20,865 --> 00:44:22,272
I love you too, Dad.

751
00:44:28,345 --> 00:44:32,006
So, what do you say
we keep looking, huh?

752
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:39,420
Dad? Are you there?

753
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:44,920
Dad, please, don't leave me alone here.

754
00:44:44,946 --> 00:44:46,287
Come on, Dad.

755
00:44:47,259 --> 00:44:48,569
You were right.

756
00:44:49,811 --> 00:44:51,209
It's not him.

757
00:44:52,227 --> 00:44:53,858
It's not Thomas.

758
00:44:58,646 --> 00:45:00,350
Where are you going?

759
00:45:05,008 --> 00:45:06,162
Dad.

760
00:45:12,313 --> 00:45:13,467
What is this?

761
00:45:13,924 --> 00:45:15,608
Victor comes here sometimes.

762
00:45:15,965 --> 00:45:18,795
This is where we spent the night
when we came out of the tunnels.

763
00:45:19,736 --> 00:45:21,514
- She's not here.
- Yeah.

764
00:45:26,411 --> 00:45:28,467
Is this how it's gonna be from now on?

765
00:45:28,857 --> 00:45:31,217
One by one, people just disappear?

766
00:45:31,512 --> 00:45:32,678
No.

767
00:45:33,623 --> 00:45:35,902
She was the first person who
made it seem like this place

768
00:45:35,928 --> 00:45:37,397
might actually be okay.

769
00:45:37,476 --> 00:45:40,233
Oh, honey, we're gonna find her.

770
00:45:40,315 --> 00:45:41,662
Don't worry. Come on.

771
00:45:44,569 --> 00:45:46,287
I don't think I was dreaming.

772
00:45:50,258 --> 00:45:51,381
What?

773
00:45:52,342 --> 00:45:54,834
When I blacked out in the ruins.

774
00:45:56,009 --> 00:45:58,802
It was almost like I went somewhere.

775
00:46:01,662 --> 00:46:02,662
Like,

776
00:46:03,748 --> 00:46:06,147
one second I'm in this weird chamber

777
00:46:06,173 --> 00:46:07,811
and the three of us are there...

778
00:46:07,845 --> 00:46:10,373
me, Randall, and Marielle,

779
00:46:12,008 --> 00:46:13,694
and we were screaming.

780
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:18,733
And then, there was this
guy chained to a wall,

781
00:46:18,759 --> 00:46:20,761
and then I'm in these tunnels,

782
00:46:20,787 --> 00:46:22,959
and I heard you talking to Victor.

783
00:46:23,952 --> 00:46:25,918
I tried to find you, but your voice,

784
00:46:25,944 --> 00:46:28,569
it kept just getting
further and further away.

785
00:46:31,695 --> 00:46:33,444
And then I heard those children.

786
00:46:34,077 --> 00:46:35,983
They were screaming that word.

787
00:46:36,634 --> 00:46:38,061
Anghkooey.

788
00:46:42,706 --> 00:46:44,358
All I kept thinking was,

789
00:46:45,971 --> 00:46:47,827
"What if I never make it back?"

790
00:46:48,547 --> 00:46:52,108
"What if... What if I'm lost
and no one ever finds me?"

791
00:46:52,584 --> 00:46:53,592
No.

792
00:46:53,618 --> 00:46:55,045
- "What if I'm alone now?"
- No.

793
00:46:55,071 --> 00:46:57,514
- I was just so scared.
- Honey.

794
00:46:59,187 --> 00:47:00,787
You're not alone.

795
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:05,045
You'll never, never be alone here.

796
00:47:06,831 --> 00:47:07,958
Okay?

797
00:47:08,641 --> 00:47:09,827
Come here.

798
00:47:20,857 --> 00:47:21,983
What is it?

799
00:47:24,837 --> 00:47:26,585
It's one of them watching us.

800
00:47:27,565 --> 00:47:28,833
The children?

801
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:29,933
Yeah.

802
00:47:31,334 --> 00:47:32,826
What is it doing?

803
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,811
She wants us to follow her.

804
00:47:38,444 --> 00:47:39,573
Follow her where?

805
00:47:39,598 --> 00:47:41,538
I don't know. Come on.

806
00:47:42,186 --> 00:47:45,428
Everything about who Victor is now,

807
00:47:45,647 --> 00:47:47,639
what he's been through,

808
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:51,561
I feel like I'm starting over
with a whole different person.

809
00:47:51,587 --> 00:47:53,012
Well, yeah, it's 'cause you are.

810
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:55,339
Look, why are you talking
to me about this?

811
00:47:55,364 --> 00:47:57,967
Why not Tabitha or...

812
00:47:59,034 --> 00:48:00,761
I don't know, literally anybody else.

813
00:48:00,786 --> 00:48:03,254
Tabitha's got her own
kids to worry about.

814
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,741
And don't take this the wrong way,

815
00:48:06,002 --> 00:48:07,560
but you remind me of him.

816
00:48:08,461 --> 00:48:09,871
I remind you of Victor?

817
00:48:09,897 --> 00:48:10,926
A little.

818
00:48:10,952 --> 00:48:13,649
He's off, trying to make a
block of wood tell a story,

819
00:48:13,675 --> 00:48:14,964
and you're up on a ladder,

820
00:48:15,008 --> 00:48:17,046
screaming at people who aren't there.

821
00:48:17,388 --> 00:48:18,616
Okay, that's fair.

822
00:48:18,889 --> 00:48:20,489
How would it be for you

823
00:48:20,514 --> 00:48:23,684
if your dad showed up here
and saw you like this?

824
00:48:23,709 --> 00:48:26,046
What would you want him to say to you?

825
00:48:27,397 --> 00:48:30,233
Well, for starters, I'd want to know
where the fuck he's been my whole life,

826
00:48:30,259 --> 00:48:32,850
but that's, that's... Listen, I...

827
00:48:33,217 --> 00:48:36,129
You're trying to figure out
how to fix him, right?

828
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,889
You can't

829
00:48:38,629 --> 00:48:40,335
'cause he's not broken.

830
00:48:40,803 --> 00:48:45,006
Victor is the product of
what this place made him.

831
00:48:45,497 --> 00:48:49,874
Victor has been surviving
here for decades.

832
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,233
He's been shaped by this place. He's...

833
00:48:53,714 --> 00:48:56,960
He's Tarzan, growing up in the jungle.

834
00:48:57,913 --> 00:48:59,387
And you're the guy who comes along

835
00:48:59,413 --> 00:49:00,837
and makes him feel like an asshole

836
00:49:00,863 --> 00:49:03,075
'cause he doesn't know
how to use a fork.

837
00:49:05,049 --> 00:49:06,788
It's not rocket science.

838
00:49:08,123 --> 00:49:09,375
Where are you going?

839
00:49:09,677 --> 00:49:11,205
Back to the bar.

840
00:49:11,231 --> 00:49:13,506
At least there I can pretend
I'm being productive.

841
00:49:18,537 --> 00:49:19,858
Fatima!

842
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:24,170
Fatima!

843
00:49:30,714 --> 00:49:32,145
You know she brought me here?

844
00:49:33,314 --> 00:49:34,847
She was my proxy.

845
00:49:36,144 --> 00:49:38,520
She helped me out a lot
since I first got here.

846
00:49:40,637 --> 00:49:42,215
She's helped a lot of people.

847
00:49:43,936 --> 00:49:45,269
It's what she does.

848
00:49:49,145 --> 00:49:52,043
I'm so sorry about what
happened to your mom.

849
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:55,488
Forget about it.

850
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:00,840
You're not going to lose Fatima.

851
00:50:01,574 --> 00:50:02,883
It's not gonna come to that.

852
00:50:02,908 --> 00:50:04,918
- She's gonna be okay.
- Okay, would you just...

853
00:50:07,101 --> 00:50:08,293
Just stop.

854
00:50:09,902 --> 00:50:10,973
Please.

855
00:50:13,948 --> 00:50:15,027
Just stop.

856
00:50:15,336 --> 00:50:18,840
All right, I appreciate
you being out here.

857
00:50:19,424 --> 00:50:20,613
I just can't...

858
00:50:28,994 --> 00:50:30,486
I have to tell you something.

859
00:50:33,356 --> 00:50:34,502
What?

860
00:50:38,403 --> 00:50:42,172
When we were on the bus on
our way here, I had a dream.

861
00:50:42,368 --> 00:50:43,821
Yeah, I remember.

862
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:45,783
And ever since then,

863
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:48,521
I feel like something has
been trying to talk to me.

864
00:50:50,729 --> 00:50:51,994
What do you mean?

865
00:50:52,874 --> 00:50:54,392
What if all this...

866
00:50:55,642 --> 00:50:58,603
What if all of this is
happening for a reason?

867
00:50:58,629 --> 00:51:01,187
What if Fatima is out there right now,

868
00:51:01,213 --> 00:51:03,283
doing something to help us?

869
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:07,677
This might be a good thing, you know.

870
00:51:07,881 --> 00:51:10,283
The baby and everything.

871
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:14,401
Wait. Why would this have
anything to do with the baby?

872
00:51:14,427 --> 00:51:17,545
No, I'm just... trying to say that...

873
00:51:17,888 --> 00:51:19,185
maybe...

874
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,771
we don't have all the information yet,

875
00:51:25,003 --> 00:51:26,177
that's all.

876
00:51:27,556 --> 00:51:30,404
I don't want you to be afraid.
I really...

877
00:51:32,294 --> 00:51:34,224
I think she's gonna be okay.

878
00:51:40,183 --> 00:51:41,287
Come on.

879
00:51:42,453 --> 00:51:43,669
Let's keep looking.

880
00:52:05,577 --> 00:52:06,895
Come on.

881
00:52:07,897 --> 00:52:09,084
Come on.

882
00:52:30,306 --> 00:52:31,829
Where are we going?

883
00:52:31,855 --> 00:52:33,696
I don't know. They've
never done this before.

884
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:38,000
- Come on, come on, come on.
- I'm coming.

885
00:52:38,985 --> 00:52:42,240
What do you want? What
do you want from me?!

886
00:52:42,812 --> 00:52:45,125
No! No, no, no.

887
00:52:45,151 --> 00:52:48,469
No, no, no! No, stay away from me.

888
00:52:48,526 --> 00:52:50,532
Stay away from me. Stay away from me.

889
00:52:50,594 --> 00:52:53,562
Stay away from me.
Stay away from me. No, no.

890
00:52:54,162 --> 00:52:56,180
No! No!

891
00:52:56,387 --> 00:52:57,821
No!

892
00:53:03,437 --> 00:53:04,743
Where is she?

893
00:53:06,543 --> 00:53:09,204
Hey. That's... that's the root cellar.

894
00:53:09,579 --> 00:53:11,891
That's the one I stayed in when
Victor pushed me through the tree.

895
00:53:13,003 --> 00:53:14,618
Someone's down there.

896
00:53:24,944 --> 00:53:26,125
Hello?

897
00:53:27,363 --> 00:53:29,118
Just stay here, okay?

898
00:53:39,554 --> 00:53:40,696
Mom?

899
00:53:42,795 --> 00:53:43,876
Mom?

900
00:53:49,992 --> 00:53:51,212
I'm okay.

901
00:54:13,554 --> 00:54:14,908
Victor?

902
00:54:19,534 --> 00:54:21,384
What are you doing here, Victor?

903
00:54:22,916 --> 00:54:24,814
This is where it happened.

904
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:30,048
This is where she left us.

905
00:54:32,581 --> 00:54:33,962
Not fair.

906
00:54:36,663 --> 00:54:40,486
All those years I thought there was
a reason, a reason that I lived.

907
00:54:44,857 --> 00:54:47,353
I was the reason she died.

908
00:54:48,801 --> 00:54:50,462
No, Victor.

909
00:54:51,134 --> 00:54:53,122
It wasn't your fault.

910
00:54:57,787 --> 00:54:59,580
You were just a little boy.

911
00:55:06,335 --> 00:55:07,600
I love you.

912
00:55:10,718 --> 00:55:12,648
I love you so much.

913
00:55:14,171 --> 00:55:15,528
No, no, no!

914
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:16,999
- What's wrong?
- No, no.

915
00:55:17,078 --> 00:55:18,365
- No, no, no, no.
- Mom, what?

916
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:19,741
No, no, that's impossible.

917
00:55:19,897 --> 00:55:21,539
- What...
- That's impossible.

918
00:55:51,535 --> 00:55:52,542
No!

919
00:55:58,688 --> 00:55:59,854
Mom!

920
00:56:01,588 --> 00:56:02,609
Mom, what?

921
00:56:02,635 --> 00:56:04,151
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

922
00:56:04,283 --> 00:56:06,479
- Mom, please, you're scaring me.
- Don't touch me!

923
00:56:06,505 --> 00:56:07,794
Mom, Mom!

924
00:56:11,277 --> 00:56:13,487
Please, how can I help you, Mom?

925
